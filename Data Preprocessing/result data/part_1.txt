hello guys so here is an amazing crash

course on developing generative AI

application using Azure open services so

AZ open Services was one of the most

requested video by all of you and I feel

that this crash course will definitely

help you learn a lot of things out there

uh this entire crash course has been

developed by S Savita uh who is an

amazing Mentor uh I will be providing

his YouTube channel in the description

of this particular video along with the

entire code materials about his GitHub

everything will be available in the

description so please make sure that you

watch this video till the end and

definitely make sure to implement each

and everything because this crash course

is going to be for 3 hours and along

with that you will be able to find out

the entire timestamps in the description

of this particular video so yes go ahead

and I've been just going to keep a

target of likes for this particular

video let's keep the target to 2,000 and

I hope uh you will be able to achieve it

as soon as possible yes go ahead and

enjoy the scratch course thank you

hey hello everyone welcome to this azir

openi crash course in this azer open

crash course we'll try to understand

each and every aspect of the azer open

and we'll try to understand it from

basic to Advanced so guys first of all

let me introduce myself my name is s

Savita and I will be your host for this

entire course I'm having around four

year of experience with data science

machine learning deep learning mlops and

and from past one year I working with

the generative AI so guys let's start so

uh first of all let me show you the pp

uh which I created for all of you uh

just to just to introduce all the

modules and all uh whatever we are going

to discuss in this particular course so

in the first module we'll discuss about

the introduction of the Azure open AI

that uh we'll try to discuss the

differences between Azure open a versus

open a then we'll see the how you can

access the a account how you can create

it and uh we'll see the subscription

method and all so we uh this Basics

first I will start this Basics only and

then after this one I will come to this

uh uh like little Advanced part where

we'll see then how we can access the

aure open a okay uh apart from this one

resource creation model

deployment understanding uh token per

minute what is this limit and this uh

request per minute and then we'll talk

about the chat playground and and will

discuss the different different model

how you can access these different

different model like GPD 3.54 Delhi

whisper and all then we'll understand

how you can use the python SDK for uh

like for using this uh chat completion

API we'll try to access the various

model using this chat completion API

we'll write the code inside our local

system and finally we are going to

create our custom web app and we'll

deploy it also now after this one after

this Aero I will come to the function

calling using Azure open we'll use it

using the python SDK only we'll try to

write a code inside the local and we'll

try to call any third party API then

after we'll discuss about the finetuning

concept of the azero we'll select the

appropriate model for the fine tuning

we'll prepare the data for it we'll talk

about the complete cost and all and

we'll see how we can find you the model

inside the azer open AI now at the and

we discuss about this a your AI studio

so guys this is very important thing a

your AI studio and uh first we'll see

how you can create a your AI Hub and the

resources we'll try to uh deploy the

various model over here and then I will

create our custom rag application so

before this one uh I was talking about

the fine tuning now after the fine

tuning I'll be discussing about the rag

so we'll create our own a complete

pipeline using this prf flow it provide

one uh specific it provide one specific

uh service that is called prom flow with

that actually we can create our own

custom application we can deploy it we

can generate the endpoint URL and we can

connect with our own custom application

also so yes at the end we we will create

our own chatbot using flask and we'll

try to consume the rag model from where

from the Azure AI studio so I hope this

syllabus is clear to all of you now uh

let's do one thing let's start up from

the Azure itself so guys once you will

search over the Google let me search in

front of
