and here is the charges for the virtual

machine okay 0.1 per hour so I'm going

to be select this standard only but if

you want to select any custom one then

definitely you can select that also uh

let me show you where this one so once

you will click on this drop down you

will be getting all the option with

respect to the machine so that is what I

was telling to you if you want to make

your process faster you can like select

the instance according to your

requirement okay now what I'm doing so

here I'm keeping it this by default uh

this a particular machine only so what

is the which is the one so here is this

EXT standard one now after this one guys

the next thing is instance count so I

will be keeping three instance okay now

inferencing data collection okay so here

I'm keeping enable only all the

information by default now review and

create now uh see you can review all the

information one more time and finally

you can click on this create now see

here my application is going to be

deploy guys so it takes time it will

take some time now how you can check you

can check inside this notification so

this is a notification guys and my model

is getting deployed so once uh it will

be deployed you will get the

notification over here inside this

particular section so let it deploy

let's wait uh for some time until what I

can do I can write my code okay for the

further thing so uh here I was returning

this render template but uh I don't want

as of now this one I'm writing a full

flag code so first is what first uh is a

if else condition so here I'm going to

be write the condition my if condition

so inside this condition guys or I can

do one thing I can give you the entire

code and we can understand like a step

by step I think that would be great so

see this is my complete code guys it is

very simple very easy nothing is here

and uh easily you can understand this

particular code so inside this code see

what I have I have my if and else

condition so if request. method is post

in that case what I'm doing I'm getting

the user query okay from my user side

I'm converting uh this query in this

particular form okay this uh Json form

then here is a body okay means I'm going

to be dump it Json do dump data and then

I'm going to be encoded right so in this

particular format actually I want my

query this is a specific format which is

required okay to sending the query to my

end Point URL now here is my URL guys so

here actually I'll be keeping my URL

which I'm generating so let me remove

this one from here and let me keep my

URL I will be showing you how you will

be getting it now remove this API key

you can keep your API key I'll be

showing you how you will be getting it

then if not API key I can generate this

particular exception now this is my

header guys okay so in the header you

can see there is my uh like content this

is what application SL here is what here

is my API key and then this is my

application name okay the deployment

name now apart from this one see here

what I have I have my request so I'm

going to be request to this particular

end you endpoint URL here is my URL and

here I'm getting the response okay now

from this particular response I'm

collecting my text okay whatever uh

thing I required and then finally I'm

going to be return it to my HTML page

getting my point if it is going to

generate any sort of error in that case

there is my exception module now you

must be thinking from where I got this

particular code so guys I didn't get it

from my end I didn't write from my end I

got it from The Tell Me from where from

the uh like uh prom flow itself I'll be

showing you after deployment you will

get the entire template over there now

here uh in the else uh it's nothing so

yes if it is not a post request in that

case uh yes we are just showing this

particular template that's it now if you

will look into the HTML code now just go

and check with the HTML code so here uh

what I have so it is very simple code

now this is my header okay head and here

is my body in my body I have one div

this one right which is showing me a

reply this a particular div and this is

my form okay you can create form before

the DI this is also fine now here is my

form which is a like which is working on
