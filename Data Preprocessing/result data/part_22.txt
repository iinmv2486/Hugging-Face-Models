 will write the city name

means once you will write a location so

what you will get you will be getting

the uh latitude and longitude of that a

specific City just copy it and keep it

over there I'll be showing you how to

call each and everything after defining

the function and all so uh I'm going to

be keep it inside where inside my file

itself got it so this three API so this

three thing now what I can do I can

replace this uh API key okay or what I

will do directly I will be pasting

inside the code itself and you will be

getting now one thing I haven't talked

about the function okay so first of all

let me Define the function so that

function basically it will fetch the

location from where it will fetch the

location from The Prompt itself right

right and then we are going to be pass

that location over here to the city name

and based on that I'm going to fetch

this latitude and longitude and finally

I'll be generating my current weather

based on my query getting my point now

let's try to perform it so uh let me

create a function guys so I already

created a definition of the function I'm

giving to you and here uh this is the

definition so inside the definition the

first name is what the first thing is

the get weather this is the name of the

function

here is the description of the function

okay description is what you can see you

are you have to retrieve the time

information data about a particular

location and place simple uh description

now parameter this is very much

important guys this particular parameter

now see uh here in the parameter

actually we have given this location so

this is going to my parameter and this

parameter I will be fetching from where

tell me this parameter I'll be fetching

I mean this location I'll be fetching

from The Prompt itself automatically it

will take it or automatically uh like

whenever we are going to be Define a

function it will collect it from the

location itself or if we are going to be

Define the a few short prom okay let's

say we are going to give a description

and based on that I have to fet some

information so that uh thing in that

specific manner I will have to mention

over here okay with those specific

parameter so later on I'll be showing

you that particular example as well but

over here I hope this thing is clear

this is a simple this is a simple

function definition so which thing we

required we required this location okay

so function calling is done now coming

to the next part so here I have to write

a code for what tell me I have to write

a code for the uh latitude and the

longitude so first I will I will be

giving the city name means the location

uh which I'm fetching from where from

The Prompt itself using this function

and then I'm going to be pass it to this

latitude and this longitude okay so uh

one more thing guys I told you that over

here inside this completion API I have

to Define the function also so let me

Define the function so here is what here

is a function parameter and which I'm

going to be defined inside my completion

API fine so everything is perfect

everything is clear now coming to the

next part now if we want to collect okay

if you want to collect this uh latitude

and longitude so we'll have to write the

further code so first of all let me

remove this print statement as of now it

is not required now just focus guys so

here is my code okay I already return it

let me give it to you this particular

code and one by one step by step I can

exper you so uh see uh this is the code

guys okay just just focus now and I just

just try to understand each and

everything whatever I have written over

here okay now the very first thing so

let me align this entire code and uh I

have to write it down just for saving

the time and uh let me explain you this

one this is a specific function for

fetching the data great guys fine so

let's uh discuss this particular

function okay so let me switch off my

camera so that you can get the access of

the entire screen and here let me remove

this also fine now just focus here so

first of all guys what we are doing see

we are going to be uh load this input

okay sorry this output whatever output

I'm getting from where from this

completion API okay so here uh what I'm

getting tell me I'm getting the output

and this particular output I'm going to

be defined inside this initial output

okay inside this particular parameter so

I have this Json let me check whether I

have Json or not so here I have
