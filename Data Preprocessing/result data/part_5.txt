 you

the a documentation related to each and

every service now what I have to do here

guys see I have to open this

documentation as your open AI now uh

this is the documentation and here just

click on this model so this is all the

like details and all related to this AER

openi but uh later on I will come to

this Kota limit deployment types and all

everything so first let me show you this

model now once I will click on this

model guys just scroll down here and you

will get one table right so inside that

table you will get you will see that

which model is accessible in which

reason okay now uh here I have selected

uh East us this reason now inside this

East us what all model is accessible

just just see over here this GPT 4613 is

not there 0613 means what it's a date it

is representing a date okay 13 June so

this is the date and here is a month got

it now this gp4 is not accessible gp4

1106 this is also not accessible gp4

0125 this is accessible then gp4 Vision

this is not accessible gp4 turbo this is

also not accessible and here you can see

the list of the model OKAY related to

what related to the tell me related to

the reason so you can easy easily check

which model is accessible in which

reason now apart from this one guys here

if you will go and check with the

pricing so we will get the complete

detail of the pricing as well according

to the according to what according to

the reason so in which reason which

model is giving you how much uh cost so

if we're going to talk about this GPD

3.5 turbo

0.25 so this is the pricing of it in

like based on the input tokens so this

input token actually it is based on the

R so 1,000 token uh sorry 1,000 token

per minute actually you can uh process

okay within this price

0.5 so likewise you can calculate other

than this one I will show you the cost

calculator as well later on I will come

to that once I will explore the a AI

studio so there I have involved the cost

calculator also for the complete cost

analysis got it because that is very

much important now uh the next one is

what Legacy model so these are the

Legacy model different different Legacy

model assistant API code interpreter and

all now base model B Bas Lain and here

you will find out that fine tuning is

not available in this reason yes guys so

if you want to do fine tuning model you

cannot do in this particular reason

definitely I will have to change the

reason so let's try to check with some

other reason so here what I'm doing so

here I'm going to be click on this South

Central us let's see whether it is

available over here or not so here guys

see it is not available in this this

particular reason also north central

reason yes so inside this reason the

spine tuning is available now you can

simply check the price and here guys you

will find out the price is very very

costly of the fine tuning yes so weage

$34 training per computer hour and uh

here you can see the hosting price input

uses per th000 token so this is the

price for the per th000 token okay then

output use is per th000 token here is a

price now just see this price $34 $68

for what for this dpd 3.5 it is a pretty

much High guys because see whenever we

are passing the data to the model okay

so it takes around around okay minimum

if you are passing minimum 5200 rows on

now so it takes around like 30 35 to 40

minute I I already seen I already

checked and in that in between that only

you will get around $60 so this fine

tuning actually it is very very costly

right so other then this one I will show

you the rag like how you can create the

rag uh basically and rag is also like

not a cheaper one it is also very costly

because uh with the rag this database

cost is associated so we'll come to the

rag and we'll try to explore the rag as

well now I hope guys you got the

overview definitely you can check out

and according to your requirement you

can select the model and you can

calculate the price now one more thing

you'll find out over here if I'm going

back so here you'll find out the

deployment types so first uh let me

click over here on this deployment type

so uh the basic one is the standard one
