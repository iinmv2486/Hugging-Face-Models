 uh uh basically this

particular data right Sports and this uh

politics and history and all but it

don't know anything about this Indian

election 24 so uh let's say if I'm going

to ask any sort of a question that who

will Who will win the election in 24

right so who

will win the election in

India in in 24 so this is my simple

question to my model now will it be able

to answer this question tell me will it

be able to answer this particular

question no it cannot answer to this

question why because it don't know

anything about this particular data we

haven't trained it we haven't trained my

model on top of this data okay so my

weights and biases actually it don't

know anything about this particular

information so what I can do so in this

case I can perform the fine

tuning fine tuning actually what it does

see so here we will be passing this

particular data so again this weights

and biases means in short I can say

parameter so my parameter actually it's

going to be adjust okay my parameter

this parameter is going to be adjust and

now if I will ask this particular

question to my model definitely I will

be getting the answer why because now I

have retrained my model on top of this

data I have adjusted my parameter this

bits and biases and now I can ask the

question related to this particular

information getting my point and this

retraining okay additional training

additional training it is called fine

tuning I hope this thing is getting

clear to all of you now let's do the F

tuning of the GPD model using this aure

open AI first of all what you have to do

guys you have to open your Azure open AI

uh a studio now inside this one just go

and check with the model so here you

will find out the various model and this

is all the pre-trained model which

someone has St and we are using just

click on this create a custom model okay

now here you find out it is telling to

you this fine tuning is not available in

this particular reason and I think I

shown you initially that uh you can

check the reason in which reason fine

tuning and all which is available so

what you can do so here uh simply you

can uh go and check with the

documentation let me show you again uh

so this fine tuning is not available

inside this East us uh but I have

created one more a your openi service

with the c uh with a South Central us

okay I will show you that just a second

so let it load or what I can do uh here

actually I can just wait so let me close

it first of all and I'm going to be open

one more as your open Ai and with that

basically I can show

you oh just a second I think my Internet

is

slow great guys so here I have opened my

Azure up here I I opened my Azure portal

now let me open this Azure open Ai and

here I already created two service so

this is my first service which is inside

this East us and the second was inside

the nor North Central us sorry I was

telling the South Central but it is

inside the north central us once I will

open it so here you will find out uh

there is a model deployment now just

click on this manage deployment and then

uh okay until I think it is loaded now

okay fine so I got it so see inside this

particular section SE this fine tuning

is not available we uh inside this fine

tuning model and what is my reason my

reason is the East us so what you can do

just click on this drop down and then

select this South Central USC still we

are not able to get the fine tune model

whatever model basically which I can

find T so just again click on this drop

down and select on this uh select this

nor Central us now see guys we are able

to get this model okay which I can find

you so web with the

$34 okay D in with the $40 uh GPD 3.5

turbo $45 GPD 3.5 turbo $68 got it now

uh what I can do so first of all let me

show you how you can f tune how you can

start your F tuning process and then uh

we'll perform we like calculate the cost

and all what might be the cost okay the

minimum cost so first of all see we are

inside this particular location north

central us now just click on this model

and then create on this custom model now

here there is a various uh stages okay

various stages which you need to fill

out so first you need to select
