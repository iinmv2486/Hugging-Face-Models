 third one is what rbsc role

based access management you can create a

specific role for the specific Services

as your keyboard for for keeping safe

your keys and all okay Keys uh and

whatever like your important information

is there if you want to keep it

somewhere uh you can keep it over here

okay now the second next one is what

service end point so here private

endpoint public endpoint both endpoint

actually you can create and you can

expose it according to your requirement

I hope this thing is getting clear what

is the primary difference between this

Azure open and open AI now model wise so

it is provide the GPD engine GPD 3.5 GPD

3.5 turbo GPD 4 gp4 o also then Tex

embedding right and then Deli engine

then chat playground evaluation and

matrixes so in short uh I can conclude

it I can say here Azure open AI it's a

completely managed service from the

Microsoft this Azure open AI is nothing

it's a collaboration of azure and open

AI getting my point now this Azure open

I what uh like it is providing to you

it's is providing the many security

features security alarms and all

everything so I hope uh if someone is

interview definitely you will be able to

clarify it now coming to the next Point
