 so

first you will have to make a request

and then only you can access this as

your openi service uh if you are not

making a request guys you won't be able

to uh access this service and this

request approval actually takes around

24hour time so within one business day

they will approve your request and then

you can utilize this particular service

I hope this thing is clear to all of you

now coming to the next point that what

is the difference between this Azure

open Ai and open AI means a your open

API and open a API okay so first of all

let me show you this open AI API so if

I'm searching over here open AI API now

uh you will get it uh so let me open it

first of all explore the API and start

building so this is what this is my h

this is my openi API right so uh yes uh

I think we all have used this openi API

and even uh on this channel itself

you'll find out many video related to

this openai API in all and uh definitely

you can generate the API key you can

access the various model we have a

various model basically here inside this

uh aure inside this openi itself like uh

GPT GPT GPT 3.5 gp4 whisper Delhi

various model right now guys uh first of

all we have to see the differences right

because until unless we are not going to

understand the

differences there will be a confusion

okay so what I did I created uh like

one like here I written the differences

for all of you I think it is visible now

so a your openi versus openi so uh just

just try to read over here what uh what

I have mentioned so a your open actually

it is providing you the managed

infrastructure okay where it is

providing you all the security right all

the security and here you can see AZ

openi offers private networking reasonal

availability and responsible AI flood TR

okay now uh on the other hand we have

this open AI so if you will uh see

inside the open so it is like I have

written over here open itself is not a

secure okay so here this Azure open like

whatever Services it is providing to you

uh like whatever security Feature

alerting Feature metrix and all I will

come to that I will explain you in a

detail I have kep couple of more images

okay so yes those feature is there

inside the a open but if you're going to

use open only open you won't get those

feature definitely you can access the

model whatever model they are providing

to providing to you and you can uh use

those model okay inside your

infrastructure so whatever

infrastructure you have created with

whatever security compliances and all so

you can use over there there but you

won't be like get the so here actually

it won't be a manage service you are

doing it by yourself it's a custom one

right which you are doing from your end

and there you are consuming this open AI

API but on the other hand if you if

you're going to see this Azure open API

it is providing you the complete manage

service means it is providing the model

along with that security different

different matrixes alert alarm and all

and here you can see the last one is

what responsible AI content filtering so

responsible AI content filtering means

what so uh like no other harmful

activity which uh like if you are

performing any harmful activity uh with

respect to that model so they will block

you okay and yes uh they will take this

action immediately so that like you

cannot perform any unusual activity now

here uh the second one is what

functionality such as uh raising an

alert whenever suspicious activity for

instance changing of a primary key are

supported so it is providing you it is

providing you multiple key okay uh

actually it provide you two key two API

key so if let's say one key is going to

be exposed so immediately it will rotate

the key okay so it is having that a

particular mechanism so automatically it

will be done now other other other than

this azeria you will find out this

functionality like there is not

supported so it is highly likely that

data T happen means uh this open a

actually it is not providing you that

type of functionality it is just

providing the simple uh key and uh not

it is not providing you the other of

functionality okay it is not providing

the other functionality related to the

security and all now coming to the

security part so in the security part

see here I have mention so first one is

what multifactor authentication the

second is what a data encryption at rest

right the
