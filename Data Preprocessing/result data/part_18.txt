 my prompt me whatever we are

saying inside where inside the video

okay so that thing I'm able to get from

here from here itself then I'm calling

this a your open okay the chat model for

the chat model only see client chat

completion create and here is what here

is my chat model this which I have

defined because I have to generate the

answer now whatever we are saying in

inside the audio so if we are asking

about the Indian player name I'm passing

it over here this is my user promp okay

so see I'm passing it inside this chat

engine so uh this is my client guys

along with endpoint URL and key we are

going to configure we are calling this

chat completion API to the chat model we

are passing this uh system prompt and

here is what here is my user prompt now

finally I'll be printing the answer

let's see whether it is able to generate

the final answer or not here I'm going

to clear my screen and let me hide to

myself so that you can get the access of

the entire if I'm searching over here if

I'm writing here Python and python

whisper. py with. py oh let's see

whether I'll be able to get or not no

module name request okay fine so here I

can mention the request also inside the

re. pxd request is here it is request

now I can install it on my terminal so

pip install request q u

let's see guys uh whether I will be able

to okay so it is installing so finally I

can run my file so

python

whisper.

py it is saying file not found error I

think there is a issue with the file let

me check guys what is a issue with the

file whether it is correct or not so

here I'm going to be copy the path and

let me paste the complete path because I

think there's a issue with the folder

name uh here I'm going to keep it and

inside this

data the file name is what voice

mp. MP4 perfect guys I have my file now

I can put the double slash because it is

required in the windows system and here

is what here is my file guys okay let's

see whether it is working fine or not

now so Python with. py and here I'm

going to execute it list out all the

player name in the great I'm able to get

my text and see guys here is what here

is my answer I hope it is perfectly

visible to you now you can pass any sort

of audio file you can generate the text

from there using the whisper model and

here you can generate the answer using

what using your chat model I hope this

thing is clear to all of you now let me

summarize what all thing we have learned

so far so I'm going through with the pp

itself now uh we understood guys about

this Azure open a okay the complete

detail introduction and after this one

we have seen so how you can access the

Azure open AI so we have seen the

playground chat completion API different

different model gbd4 g3.5 I shown you

standard quota provision quota

everything pricing detail and all I hope

this is perfect now my next point is

going to be a function calling using a

your open a so if you want to make a

function calling how you can do that now

apart from this one fine tuning and this

a your AI studio so this will take some

time this a your AI Studio but fine

tuning and function calling it won't

take any time okay like that much time

let's start with the function calling so

guys let's try to understand the basic

and the fundamental concept of the

function calling and then we'll go for

the python implementation so here uh let

me open my Blackboard on my Blackboard I

kept one image and by using this image I

will try to explain you the fundamental

concept of the function calling so uh

here let's say my user is asking a query

so here is my user and he is asking a

query uh through the chat interface now

what is the chat interface guys so chat

interface uh it could be any UI UI of

the chatboard and QA system so here it

is calling okay so whenever I'm writing

a qu query it is calling to my openi API

through the chat completion API itself

so I'm going to be Define my chat

completion inside my Cod and then we are

calling this openi API now inside this

chat completion API I'm going to Define

one function okay so this function it is

extracting the information from where

from the user prompt so whatever prompt

I'm going to be defined So based on that

particular prompt it's going to be

extract some information and then it is

calling
