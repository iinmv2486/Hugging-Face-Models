 to some third party API okay and

then from there itself it is fetching

the information got it now uh I hope

this thing is clear but let's try to

understand it by using the example and

then we'll try to implement that same

example okay in the python code only so

uh let's say uh here is a user now this

user actually uh this uh wants to

understand or this wants to know about

the latest weather of the Mumbai now uh

here is what uh here I'm calling my GPD

model GPD uh let's say 3.5 now this GPD

3.5 it does not know the latest weather

of the Mumbai or any other city like

Delhi bangaluru bopal indor whatever

right now this uh openi actually openi

model it I don't know the like current

weather of the model so what it will do

guys so inside this one what I will do

so here I will be defining one function

now this function okay it will take this

location it will take this location and

after collecting this location what will

happen you know so it is going to be

called this third party API for what for

extracting the external information so

here I got the location let's say I got

the Mumbai now uh based on my code

whatever code I'm going to be write

whatever description I'm going to be

write based on that let's say it's going

to be called this weather API we e a t h

e r weather API okay now now this

weather API based on the location it is

providing me a information and then this

information is coming uh the response is

coming to my chat completion API itself

and finally it is going to the user

itself I hope the understanding is clear

to you now if someone is going to ask

you in the interview why we use this

function calling what is the use of this

open a function calling so simply you

can say that so this model this uh this

this particular model this llm model it

does not aware about with the it does

not aware with the latest information

okay or the recent information so those

information we can fetch externally from

outside and there this function calling

comes we can extract the like necessary

inputs from where from The Prompt itself

and based on that I can call my further

code for calling the external API for

fetching the information I hope this

thing is clear now let's try to

implement it in a python so here guys uh

let me do one thing let me so here all I

created one file function calling uh f c

okay fine this is fine now here itself

I'm going to write my code so uh let me

write the import statement import OS

then uh here I'm going to be import one

more module that is going to be a

dequest then from uh open here itself

I'm going to be open uh I'm going to be

import this as your openi so let me

import this as your open guys perfect so

I have imported this now now what I'm

doing I'm going to be create one method

method name is going to be main now uh

here inside this method uh what I can do

I can test it whether it is working fine

or not so I can simply write a testing

over here so let me write this testing

now what I can do I can call this

particular method so let me call this

method Main and here I can call it

inside this if condition so if a name is

equal to is equal to M okay now perfect

I hope everything is fine uh so what I'm

doing guys so first of all let me switch

off my camera so that you can get access

of my screen now what I will do so here

uh actually I'm going to be run this

particular file so simply uh I have to

write this python function calling uh

where I'm writing it guys just a second

what is happening let me open the

command prom I think that is fine now

let me write here python function call

great so if everything is fine guys I'll

will be getting my testing okay perfect

so I'm getting my testing now I have to

write my further code so let me write uh

the further code so first of all what I

have to do guys so I have to Define my

client uh I already shown you this uh

chat completion API right so from here

itself I'm going to take this client now

uh let me copy this CLI and here I'm

going to paste it inside my main

function got it guys now this client

actually it is required two things first

is endpoint and the second is what the

second is API key so let me Define this

end point and this API key over

here so guys this API key and endpoint

from
