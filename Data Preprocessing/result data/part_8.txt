 uh to this one so let me

show you just wait I think I can hide to

myself okay this one guys see here is

the option request Kota so once you will

click over here on this request Kota so

it will contact your Microsoft account

team to request provision through P Kota

okay fine so I think I will have to take

a advanced subscription for accessing

this particular model I believe this

thing is getting clear to all of you now

uh for some model actually you can

access from here itself so let's say if

I want to access this particular model

gp3 gp4 turbo uh let's uh see okay no

for this one also I think I will have to

make my uh I will have to like take a

advanced subscription got it so uh

whatever thing is there inside the

standard I'm going to use only those

particular model I believe this thing is

clear to all of you now let's make a

deployment of few models and let's start

to use it for our chatting purpose or

for the content generation and all so

click on the deployment and here we can

easily like do our work with our GPD 3.5

or Turbo as well and here in this

particular regon see in the standard

region this GPD 4 is also available so

yes we can use this gbd4 for what for

the images for the image related thing

now uh let me select first GP 3.5 turbo

and here I can write the deployment name

so this is going to my chat engine and

here guys see this is a token limit

token per minute uh rate limit so what's

the meaning of it token per minute rate

limit so in 1 minute actually how many

tokens you can proceed okay so you can

increase it according to your

requirement token means what the number

of words uh so inside one sentence like

how many tokens is there how many words

is there it is asking about to this one

right this second is one so

corresponding to this limit see if you

are going to increase the limit so this

limit is also increasing so this limit

actually RPM it is showing to you

request per minute okay so in uh 1

minute how many request you are making

right to your API so I hope this two

thing is clear it is pretty much

important now I'm keeping it low because

I for this practice I not required this

much of like RPM and this TPM I can

simply keep it 30,000 only that's it now

what I can do I can simply click on this

create and see my deployment is going on

so once I will deploy I can access the

model inside this chat section see now

apart from this one guys uh we can take

one more model so the model is what gp4

so which model guys gp4 Omni I'm going

to be select gp4 Omni because it is

available inside this ex standard price

so just click over here and then you can

write the name of the deployment this is

what your this is your Omni model then

uh you can select the PPM and RPM and

then finally you can create

so see your model is getting created and

now it's successfully deployed so what

you can do you can go inside this chat

and now you won't able to find out that

a particular issue so see this is what

this is my complete chat playground this

is my complete chat completion API so uh

if you want to select the model simply

you can uh click on this drop down I

think it is visible let me uh let me

switch off my video this one guys chat

engine in the deployment itself you can

see this one so once you will click over

here you'll find out this chat engine

and this Omni model this Delhi it is

only for this particular playground okay

it is not for this chat Playground now

uh what I can do I can use this

particular model so let's say I want to

use this chat uh engine simply I can

write my message hi and what I once I

will hit enter guys so here uh see it

will be generating one error and this is

not for me this is for the everyone so

whoever uh basically it is uh using this

particular model xess dened to invalid

subscription key or wrong API end point

active

subscription and current API okay I

think I was getting this uh 5 minute

error because within 5 minute actually
