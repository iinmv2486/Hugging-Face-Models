first please change the model uh where

is the model guys this is the option for

the model uh chat engine is fine great

now finally I can check so let's see

whether it is generating or not so yes

it is generating now I think see it is

generating related to what what Rel to

the code uh I think I will have to

define the chat context from here like

let's say I'm going to be Define this

question answering so here what I can do

I can ask any sort of a question and

according to that is going to generate

answer how many NE are is there let me

predefined template okay now I can ask

my uh my question basically so what is

your name let's say so if I'm going to

ask any custom question definitely it

will be able to generate the answer so

no the model consider model modifying

your prompt and parameter to behavior

question whatever uh context they have

given likewise you can check but yes

getting with this particular one no text

by the consider modifying your prompt

and parameter to improving the PRS okay

fine so I think guys uh we'll have to

check what I can do from here but yes uh

you can explore it and you can run it

now uh the main thing basically which I

want to show you over here that is what

there is a view code now once you will

go and check with this view code so you

will get the code and guys this code

actually it is uh representing to the

previous one okay the uh code related to

the previous version definitely you can

copy and you can check it

now uh coming to the next Point here see

Delhi so if I'm such if I'm writing

anything over here uh inside this prompt

let's say I'm writing uh give me a

image where where person or where boy is

cycling and girl

City behind him so this is what this is

my prompt now let me generate it and

let's see what I'll be getting

here will take some time and again uh

whatever images you are

generating like with it the price is

associated

okay fine so see guys how like uh like

they have generated the image so here is

a boy and the girl is sitting behind

this boy anything you can gener you can

download it from here you can delete it

and one more thing show code so just

click over here on this show code and

here guys you will get the code as well

now let's see how we can use this python

SDK right for accessing this model so

first of all uh these three things is

required first is what endpoint URL then

API key and then this code let me copy

this endpoint URL and see already I have

created this uh environment and all

everything so here my folder name is

what your openi crash course inside this

one this is my environment EnV here is

my file where where I didn't I haven't

written anything and this is my require.

txt file okay so what I'm doing I'm

creating one more file the file name is

going to be deli. py now inside this

del. py uh the first thing is what

endpoint URL so let me keep it this

endpoint URL and guys this is a

confidential thing so please don't

expose to anyone and after the session I

will also delete it so no one can access

it so here is what here is my endp point

URL I can do one thing I can create EnV

file also over here and there also I can

keep my confidential information and

directly I can read it inside by file

but as of now directly I'm mentioning

over here in front of you only now the

next thing is what API key so let me

take the API key also from where from

this code so I'm copying over here this

API key now perfect now the third thing

is what guys here I want to write a code

so this is going to my code now let we

copy it and here I'm going to be paste

it so this is my code now see guys here
