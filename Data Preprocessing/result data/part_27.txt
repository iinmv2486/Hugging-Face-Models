going to be open it inside the notepad

and see guys so if you will look into

the data so guys this is very mandatory

and necessary thing please be careful

here you have to keep your data in this

specific format only okay this is here I

have kept 10 lines because one more

thing if you're providing uh less than

10 line okay here is a 10 10 line

basically inside my data if you're

providing less than 10 line in that case

it won't accept it means the GPD model

it won't accept it it will reject it so

inside your data there should be minimum

10 lines okay let let me show you one

line uh so what I kept over here so what

I'm going to do I'm going to select this

line completely and here after selecting

it I'm going to be open my Json viewer

am searching or sorry there I'm pasting

this particular line so here is my line

right now format so see guys so this is

the data okay in this specific format I

have to pass the data first is what

first is the role so here I'm defining

the role of the model so I'm saying you

are a customer support agent for the

smartphone company who who whose primary

goal is to help user with the issues

they are experiencing with their

smartphone you are friendly and concise

you only provide factual answer to the

query and do not provide answer that are

not related to the smartphone right

because I want to train my GPD model on

a specific data okay on a smartphone

data which maybe don't know so let's say

if I'm going to ask anything to my GPD

model into the smartphone and if it is

not able to answer I can train it

specifically I can train on train it on

that particular data and that is what

I'm providing over here so the first

thing you have to provide the data in

this specific format and the second

thing is what

at least 10 line inside your data the

third one is what the extension should

be Json L Json line got it so perfect

and here is what here is my user
