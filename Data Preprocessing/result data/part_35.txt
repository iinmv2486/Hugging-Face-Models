 show

you this Comm python

app.py now see my application is running

now if I will open it so guys see this

is my chatbot page a very uh simple and

very easy uh very simple page over here

just to test the queries and all nothing

else so if you want to create any full

full flag chatbot and all full flag

chatbot page I can do that also but uh

later on I'll be showing you in my some

other video here just for the testing

around so guys uh let's do one thing

let's close it as of now and then uh

let's stop this particular process and

I'm going back to where I'm going back

to my Azo open AI now see here uh it is

showing to me that it has created okay

this index is created now where actually

sorry the chunking is done and here now

it is creating the index and all so the

first step is done chunking and the

Second Step what like it will be

creating the eming and all okay and then

on top of it like this entire thing

basically it's going to be keep inside

the index and then I can perform the

retrieval operation and all so uh I hope

uh this is done now if you want to check

how the process is going on so just do

one thing so just go inside this uh let

me show you where index is so once you

will click on this index just open this

particular index

okay now inside this index here is a one

option that option is called job detail

once you will click on this job detail

you will find out the entire detail of

this with respect to this particular job

so whatever job you have seen right you

will be finding out the detail step by

step detail with respect to that

particular job now here uh it is telling

to you my uh recent workspace my live

project just a second guys yeah this one

now just uh scroll down and see these

are the particular jobs guys inside this

Vector so what is my Vector name my

Vector index I think my name I written

in this way okay fine not an issue and

yes so this index is also completed and

now registering this particular index so

uh first of all let me uh like tell you

one thing let me talk about the rag

architecture until it is Crea I can give

you like little information related to

this rag architecture and all so in the

rag architecture what we do so let's say

we have a data now what I will do I will

be collecting this data and this

particular data I will be uh like

storing somewhere okay let's say this

data I kept inside the database then uh

from this particular database I'll will

be collecting this data again in the

form of chunks okay chunking I'll

perform the chunking because this data

might be very very huge so let's say

this is what this is my

chunks now with respect to this chunk

I'll be creating the embedding Okay so

so here I can write chunk this is also

my chunk here also my chunk okay now

I'll be creating the embedding so

embedding is nothing it's a numerical

representation of the data so here is

what here is my embeding this is also

repres to the representing same thing

and here also embedding now this

particular embedding guys whatever

embedding we have created I'll be

storing inside where inside the vector

database so here here is what here is my

Vector database or like this Vector

database or you can say Vector index

because this Vector database actually it

will provide you the vector index so the

same process is happening over there

itself so what they are doing you know

so whatever data I have provided the

shoe data they collected it means they

kept inside the database aure blob they

created a chunk from there okay if it is

required they will create otherwise no

because I kept every setting by default

so I'm assuming that they have created a

Chun because the process I can see over

there

then they have performed the iding with

respect to that the model right so

emding model which I loaded so by using

that particular model they have

performed the iding and then they stored

it right where inside the vector

database means by default they are using

the vector database or uh basically with

respect to that they are creating this

Vector index okay Vector database

actually it provide you the vector index

getting my point now what will happen

you know so whenever user is asking any

sort of a query so here let's say is my

query which is being asked by the user

so it will perform the similarity search

based on this particular query so let me

mention the similarity

search and here this uh context I will

be
