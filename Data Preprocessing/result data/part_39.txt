this particular URL uh this slash only

and here I'm taking a user input okay

now after taking this user input what

I'm doing I'm uh like I'm click like we

are clicking on this submit and finally

uh I'll be getting my reply over here

based on the like query okay so this is

a simple HTML which uh I have written

for all of you and here is what here is

my app.py file now I have to keep this

two information over here so uh what I

can do I can check whether it is

deploying or not uh Let me refresh uh

this particular process and uh here I

think uh it is deploying so just a

second let me check guys whether it is

deploying or not

reloaded uh yeah see deployment is uh

yes yes yes it is deploying so just go

and check with the deployment detail you

will be getting each and everything over

here itself so detail is here guys this

one and uh here is what here is my URL

this one and this is my key okay right

hand side you can check and is still it

is creating see if you are not getting

the deployment and all inside the

notification you can simply refresh it

getting my point so uh here see it is

deploying and now this is my endpoint

URL which is required to me I'm just

going to be copy from here and simply

going to paste inside my code okay now

the next thing is what so here the next

thing is this uh API key so just copy

this API key from here and then keep it

inside your code okay so here I'm going

to be keep my API key now uh both thing

is done now what is required so here I

required my application name so I can

remove this my project this one and what

I can do I can keep my name so here is

my name guys crash course r y DD so this

is the name basically which was there

and if you remember then at the end

basically there was one so uh crashed

course r u y dd1 so this is the

particular uh requ request header and I

hope this is clear to all of you now

once it will be done guys I'll be making

the request to my endpoint URL it takes

some time so if you have initialized uh

maybe uh at 150 and it will be done

within like 10 to 15 minute this is a

very minimum time for it it might take

more than that uh as well so if you want

to increase the time in that case you

will have to play with the instance

configuration and all everything so let

it complete and then uh we'll hit the

URL guys

so here guys you can see my deployment

is done so uh uh guys uh whatever name

uh basically I given to the deployment

it was giving me the issue uh I just I

check with the log and all because uh

previously during my practice I already

created with the same name so what I did

I uh changed my name over here rest of

the process will be same nothing uh will

be there so uh you can check out uh

inside the log okay here is a log or

else uh you will be getting the

notification also right so uh it was

giving me the issue that's why I changed

the name and again I redeploy it with

the same process which I shown you so

after the deployment you will be able to

find out this type of page okay now uh

here you can see provision succeed and

then uh here is what here is my endpoint

URL the same one and is what here is my

API key now what I can do I can keep

this endpoint URL where inside my code

and this key as well so let me copy the

key and uh already I pasted this URL

here you can see this one now let me

keep the key as well got it so I have my

key and I have my URL over here and

along with that this is what this is my

name okay as your model deployment name

now one more thing I can show you over

here see you can test it you can test it

inside the uh Azure itself okay over the

portal as well so let me write High over

here so definitely it is going to be the

answer now let me ask can you give me a

price of Nike Air Max sh true so let's

see what I'll be getting so if

everything is perfect then it will

generate the price yes I'm getting it

and here is the price is what 150 USD

now I was telling to you that if I want

to connect it with the my application

right I connect it with the flask and

all so from where I will get the

template so guys see just click on this

consume after it here
