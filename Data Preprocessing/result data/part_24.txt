 API key and

all everything so let me remove it and

then everything is fine everything is

perfect so uh let me revise the code

once and then I'm going to be execute it

and we'll get the weather from the

different different cities and all so uh

first what I did I defined this main

function this is my endpoint key key

endpoint and this API key this is my

client okay and and by using this client

I'm going to be create this chat

completion API there this is my model

and here is what here is my message then

I have defined the function for what for

fetching the information from The Prompt

itself so this is my function and here

I'm fetching the location and based on

this location okay I'm going to be fetch

the uh like necessary information okay

so here I'm going to be F the location

from where from this particular response

and then uh based on this this

particular location I'm going to be

called the open weather map API and here

is my final weather so let's see whether

it is working or not so first of all I'm

going to be clear my screen just a

second CLS and then let me call this

python function calling.

py great guys so let's wait and

check fine it is telling to me uh Json

decode Json coder expert value line

number one okay at which line I'm

getting error guys let me check over

here line number 65

line number 65 okay and then line number

42 maybe I missed something over here uh

line number

42 Json

loads and here is what function

argument great guys this is perfect Now

function argument is the location

itself okay wait guys let me check what

is the issue so here guys you can see we

are getting our output so what was the

issue so ISS issue basically it was was

with the model so here there what I did

uh I just changed my model means I

redeployed that particular model and now

I'm getting the output because uh see

I'm passing the input uh prompt to the

model and it was not able to generate

the final output this uh sorry not final

one this initial uh like output this

initial response and because of that it

was not able to decode this uh Json

basically that's why it was generating

the issue so what I did I did nothing I

just like uh redeploy the model maybe it

was not able to connect and now I'm able

to get my answer so let me show you how

it is going to work I will give you the

entire code and in a similar way you can

test if you are getting the same error

which I am getting in that case you can

restart your model or you can delete the

previous uh deployment and then you can

redeploy it and then finally uh it will

give you the answer so uh let me check

with the other location over here so

here uh I tested with the Bal uh here

let me write the Delhi so after writing

a Delhi I can uh write over here this

python function calling now see uh once

I learn it guys here you can see the

city name is Del latitude is this one

longitude is this one and here is the

weather condition so the weather

condition is has now uh see if you want

to uh if you want to know more

information about the weather you can

get it so here it will give you the

complete and a detailed information

about the weather I'm just going to be

check the like type of the the weather

the weather condition which I'm going to

be uh collected from here and finally

I'm printing it that's it but if you

want to get a like a temperature cloudy

this that whatever right so here you'll

be able to find out inside this

particular variable now uh what I can do

I can show you so I can I'm going to be

print this final response so that you

will be getting what all information

actually I can get with respect to the

weather so uh here uh again let me run

it python function calling. py and uh

now see it is Delhi ltitude longitude

great and see guys here weather

condition is has but apart from this one

it is giving me each and every

information so here's is the description

now humidity pressure temperature

temperature minimum feace like okay

every information so uh see guys over

here uh you will be finding out finding

it out for the console itself I hope

this thing is clear now uh what we can

do so we can understand the next module

now in the next module guys let me go

back to the uh let me uh go back to the

PPT so we are done with the function

calling in the next module I'll be

showing you this fine tuning so the fine
