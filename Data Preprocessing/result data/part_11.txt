is API key grade so this is what this is

my method client image generate here I'm

passing my model name Delhi okay here is

what here is my prompt give me a image

where is a y great and N is equal to one

provide me what it will provide me a

image URL so let me print this image URL

so image uncore URL let's see what I

will be getting over here so my

installation is done if you want to

check which version I have installed so

here simply you can check with the open

AI API open

AI Pi okay so just search about this

openi pii you will get the version of

this openi pii

130.3 now you can go and check inside

the release history also so the

completion API actually it was available

in 0. X okay

so it was available in this particular

version in this 0.28

0.281 so uh like from 1.x actually it is

not available you will find out this

chat completion API you can check out

you can go and check by U yourself as

well I don't have any issue so coming to

the point now so everything is fine I

can cross check also now once I will

write python over here so I can copy

this a your open and then I can paste it

so if everything is fine I will be able

to load it yes it is working fine for me

now exit and then I'm executing this

particular file so for executing this

file simply I need to write this Python

and this file name Deli do3 I hope it is

visible to all of you if not let me

switch off my camera so here see what I

need to write I need to write this Deli

3. py or deli. py only this is my file L

now see uh I'm running it and if

everything is fine guys it is going to

generate this URL at the end it will

provide me a image URL so it is calling

that API and after calling this API I

can access the image just wait just a

second great I'm getting my URL now just

click over here and see here is what

here is your image this one guys so

again like it has gener different image

because second time I'm calling it

and yeah I hope you are seeing the image

and you will be able to generate it also

now you can write a logic wherever you

want to save the image wherever you want

to generate a number of image but again

I'm saying cost is associated with it if

you want to check the cost definitely

you can check out you can go inside the

price section okay I think I already
