 test it in that

case I will have to pay at least $30

guys okay where I'm and where I'm

calculating the training time just for

half an hour let's say if I'm having a

huge amount of data in that case uh it

will take around

like 2 to 3 hour or maybe more than that

so the charge is going to be very very

huge and guys you won't believe me I got

$120 will within half an hour only so

that's why I'll be sto sorry $120 will

within one and a half hour okay so

that's why I will be stopping the

process and yes uh rest of the thing is

fine now if you want to calculate into

the Indian rupees so simply uh what you

can do 30 into let's say I can take 883

only so $1 is equal to 83 RUP now here

is the prices around

2.5k right rupia so that will be a price

for what for the fine tuning just for 1

hour that's why I was saying it is

costly and I think you got to know the

process of the fine tuning so let me

stop it because it is going to be run uh

now here see here you can see inside the

notification and all it is creating the

fine tune model now uh here I can delete

it so so perfect it is not at all

required so yes I hope you got to know

about the fine uni now let's try to

understand the next thing uh let me open

the PPD itself so now we'll be talking

about this a your AI Studio

guys now in this Azure AI Studio guys

first we'll start with the Azure AI Hub

I will create the Azure AI Hub and the

other resources then uh I will deploy

the model or I will see that how I will

show you that how we can use the model

from the AZ openi directly from the AI

also you can connect okay inside this

azui studio we'll create our own rag uh

mean means our custom rag and uh then uh

here we going to steam like the entire

pipeline using this promp flow it is a

very amazing Service uh which is being

provided by the aori studio then we'll

create an endpoint URL okay means I will

deploy the application finally and we we

will be consuming it inside our local

application so here we're going to

create one flask application and there I

will show you how you can consume this

endpoint URL okay now before it starting

with this Azor EI Studio you should be

aware about this azori studio guys so uh

what you can do you can check out with

the uh Microsoft itself with the

official page of the Microsoft now just

see uh what they are saying about this

Azure AI studio so Azure AI Studio it's

a unified platform for developing and

deploying generative AI application so

if you you want to create generative

related application if you want to

deploy it okay so this a plateform will

help you from starting to end it's a

unified it's a single platform for

everything and it's pretty amazing guys

definitely you will get to know once

I'll be showing the entire functionality

of this a AI studio now you can check

the overview so inside the overview they

have mentioned explore the model craft

it then design it then roliz is okay so

you can uh like like like get a

evaluation and all evalution metrics and

all at the single place after deployment

and all then uh here you can see the

benefit so what is the benefit it is

going to be improve the customer

experience it is reducing the

organization risk okay improve work

quality and then enhance productivity

and all capabilities so yes uh these are

the capability you can build your own

co-pilot Enterprise check okay that we

are going to be create here incorporate

multimodality means you can uh like keep

all the models the different different

type of model and one very amazing thing

I will show you and you will literally

Sol so uh okay just wait I will be

showing you that now analyzis spe yes

you can analyzis the speech also so yes

you can go through with it and pricing

and all everything they have mention and

yes definitely you will be able to get

each and everything now coming to this

AO AI studio so for that what I will

what I have to do first I have to open

the Azure portal so I'm going to be open

the Azure portal inside the new new uh

like uh inside a new

browser new window guys so this is what

this is my a portal now let me click it

and here guys just a second let me do

the sign in and this is what this is my

a
