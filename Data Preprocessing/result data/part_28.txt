 user

question and this is the answer so uh

yeah now what I can do I can uh upload

the file which I already selected now

after uploading the file see it is

getting uploaded I can simply select

it it is in progress

guys great I got my file now just select

it okay done then just click on this

next and it is asking about the

validation just select this file great

validation is done Okay now click on

this next and here these are the like

some option which is which it is giving

to you how many number of epo you want

to run in number of epo EPO means what

forward propagation plus back

propagation that is called one EPO so uh

if you will go and check with the custom

one you will find out you can increase

the number of AO by default actually is

two only now B size if you have lots of

data if you like would like to uh

provide the data in the batches as of

now there is only one batch means we are

providing the entire data but if you

want to increase the B size you can do

it that is also possible now our

learning rate like multiplier so yes

that is also like you can you can like

put and here you can uh Define the seed

value also okay so these are the thing

basically which I'm keeping by default

only and here I I'm going to be click on

this next and see this is the like final

information and then you can start your

training job now once you will click on

this training job so here see guys it it

has started with a fine tuning so this

is what this is my fine tuning progress

now let it complete and uh I won't

complete it guys because it's going to

be charge you a lot and I don't want it

and guys uh believe me not even charge

it will take the time as well so if I

want to get this particular model so the

charge this uh trading time it will take

around 30 to 35 minute and after 35

minute I'll will be getting the model

after 15 minutes so this is a 1 hour

effort okay 1 hour process with a 10

line only just just think guys how big

the model is and how much time it will

take with a like just a small it's just

like with a 10 line only if you are

passing like 100 line or 150 line so it

might take uh maybe 2 Hour 3 Hour 4 Hour

it depends on the data only so here

first of all let me calc the cost and

then uh I think this is done uh so yeah

then I will be stopping the stopping

this particular process and see after uh

like training this particular model so

you'll be getting it over here itself

okay inside your model then definitely

you can uh deploy it and then you can

use inside your chat engine or else you

can consume it inside the local in a

similar way we are going to be we are

consuming the other model getting my

point so on let me repeat it once you

will uh like train this particular model

okay so you will be getting over here

along with all the model you can deploy

it over here inside this section and

then you can utilize it directly inside

your playground or else you can access

it inside your local system as well

using the get completion API fine now uh

let's discuss about the price and all so

let's say I have decided this particular

model so the price is what training per

compute R is what 45 tell me guys

$45 so here I am going to be open My

Epic pen uh let's try to calculate some

sort of a price so here guys let's

say um

great perfect so uh let's say guys here

the price for the per computer R is what

$45 okay so if we going to talk about

here or instead of this one I can open

my calculator just a second because I

think it is giv some

problem $45 for the per computer let's

say if I'm going to be uh if my process

going to be for the half an hour so you

can uh divide it by two itself so there

will be around 23 okay now apart from

this one here hosting per hour let's say

I'm going to be hosted for the uh this

particular model for uh let's say 2 hour

okay so here uh what is this tell me $3

so here I'm going to be add more $6 now

apart from this one see input uses per

th000 token so this is fine this is are

very less charges I can add $1 more so

here around $30 so if I want to use this

model if I just want to
