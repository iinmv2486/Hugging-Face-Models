hello guys so here is an amazing crash

course on developing generative AI

application using Azure open services so

AZ open Services was one of the most

requested video by all of you and I feel

that this crash course will definitely

help you learn a lot of things out there

uh this entire crash course has been

developed by S Savita uh who is an

amazing Mentor uh I will be providing

his YouTube channel in the description

of this particular video along with the

entire code materials about his GitHub

everything will be available in the

description so please make sure that you

watch this video till the end and

definitely make sure to implement each

and everything because this crash course

is going to be for 3 hours and along

with that you will be able to find out

the entire timestamps in the description

of this particular video so yes go ahead

and I've been just going to keep a

target of likes for this particular

video let's keep the target to 2,000 and

I hope uh you will be able to achieve it

as soon as possible yes go ahead and

enjoy the scratch course thank you

hey hello everyone welcome to this azir

openi crash course in this azer open

crash course we'll try to understand

each and every aspect of the azer open

and we'll try to understand it from

basic to Advanced so guys first of all

let me introduce myself my name is s

Savita and I will be your host for this

entire course I'm having around four

year of experience with data science

machine learning deep learning mlops and

and from past one year I working with

the generative AI so guys let's start so

uh first of all let me show you the pp

uh which I created for all of you uh

just to just to introduce all the

modules and all uh whatever we are going

to discuss in this particular course so

in the first module we'll discuss about

the introduction of the Azure open AI

that uh we'll try to discuss the

differences between Azure open a versus

open a then we'll see the how you can

access the a account how you can create

it and uh we'll see the subscription

method and all so we uh this Basics

first I will start this Basics only and

then after this one I will come to this

uh uh like little Advanced part where

we'll see then how we can access the

aure open a okay uh apart from this one

resource creation model

deployment understanding uh token per

minute what is this limit and this uh

request per minute and then we'll talk

about the chat playground and and will

discuss the different different model

how you can access these different

different model like GPD 3.54 Delhi

whisper and all then we'll understand

how you can use the python SDK for uh

like for using this uh chat completion

API we'll try to access the various

model using this chat completion API

we'll write the code inside our local

system and finally we are going to

create our custom web app and we'll

deploy it also now after this one after

this Aero I will come to the function

calling using Azure open we'll use it

using the python SDK only we'll try to

write a code inside the local and we'll

try to call any third party API then

after we'll discuss about the finetuning

concept of the azero we'll select the

appropriate model for the fine tuning

we'll prepare the data for it we'll talk

about the complete cost and all and

we'll see how we can find you the model

inside the azer open AI now at the and

we discuss about this a your AI studio

so guys this is very important thing a

your AI studio and uh first we'll see

how you can create a your AI Hub and the

resources we'll try to uh deploy the

various model over here and then I will

create our custom rag application so

before this one uh I was talking about

the fine tuning now after the fine

tuning I'll be discussing about the rag

so we'll create our own a complete

pipeline using this prf flow it provide

one uh specific it provide one specific

uh service that is called prom flow with

that actually we can create our own

custom application we can deploy it we

can generate the endpoint URL and we can

connect with our own custom application

also so yes at the end we we will create

our own chatbot using flask and we'll

try to consume the rag model from where

from the Azure AI studio so I hope this

syllabus is clear to all of you now uh

let's do one thing let's start up from

the Azure itself so guys once you will

search over the Google let me search in

front of you so if you will go and

search aor so here I can write aor AI

Services okay aor AI services so you

will get all the services which is being

provided by the Azo itself now uh simply

you can sign in if you have account uh I

will be coming to the account first of

all let me show you all the services so

guys uh these are the services or here I

can search over the portal itself was AO

AI Services okay so uh see guys this is

all the services which is being provided

by the Azure AI so first is openi itself

then AI search then computer vision face

API then spe service custom Vision

language service translation document

intelligence is one of them board

service anom detective there are various

services and here directly you can use

the service and uh you can create your

own custom application you can configure

it in your own custom way and then you

can utilize it guys okay now a your AI

Services is fine so here first basically

we are going to be start this a your

open account itself and then I will come

to the AI studio right this two thing

this both thing is different this AZ

your open AI account uh and this a your

AI Studio okay so uh apart from this one

we have this document intelligence also

where we can upload the document and and

for that we'll have to configure the

database and all yes for these Services

also like a your openi studio and a your

AI Studio we'll have to configure the

database and that service is also very

very easy no need to do anything it's a

very uh like simple simple thing and

here itself uh in this particular

tutorial I will show you now first of

all guys what you need to do so see you

need to sign up right if you don't have

any account so here I already log in

with my account account so if you don't

have any account guys first of all you

need to sign up to the Azure portal now

let me write over here Azure portal so

if you will write this as your portal

guys you will get it this one so first

of all sign up over here uh you can sign

up with your Gmail ID your outlook or

with your third party account as well if

it is giving you the permission then

after the sign up so once you will sign

up uh then definitely you can login over

here and then after the login you will

find out this particular page okay this

is the homepage of the azard portal now

there are so many option guys so many

services and all so first of all what

you have to do you have to add the

subscription now once you will click on

this subscription guys see this is here

are they are giving the option of the

subscription just click over here so I

already added the subscription see uh

here this subscription plays a very

important role uh definitely it will

provide you the $ 300 free dollar credit

but uh you cannot use it for most of the

services it is uh like those credit you

can only use for some services like for

creating a basic B app and all okay free

tire B app that's it nothing uh like

else so if you want to use this AZ your

open a or other storage account or aure

Ai Se or different other services

related to the AI definitely you will

have to add the subscription yes guys

this is very much important so uh first

of all you have to create your

subscription you can simply create click

on this ad you can write your

subscription name and uh yes you can add

your uh you can add your card or you can

add your like uh you can you can add

your debit card credit card whatever it

is asking and finally you can start

using it so if you will see guys here it

is providing you this a free credit but

again uh 55 Services it is providing to

you so you can go and check out but uh

believe me guys this openi service you

cannot exist inside this free tile you

will have to you will have to add this

pay as you go uh over here right now I

think this subscription and account is

fine to all of you and I believe you can

do it you can create it now coming to

the next point so uh here what we have

guys see here we have this azer open AI

now I will search it inside the search

box definitely I will be getting it so

let me search over here this azer open

see I'm getting it so uh if you are uh

if you are searching it first time the

uh definition you will you won't get a

option for creating it so first you will

have to uh like make a request okay so

first you will have to make a request

and then only you can access this as

your openi service uh if you are not

making a request guys you won't be able

to uh access this service and this

request approval actually takes around

24hour time so within one business day

they will approve your request and then

you can utilize this particular service

I hope this thing is clear to all of you

now coming to the next point that what

is the difference between this Azure

open Ai and open AI means a your open

API and open a API okay so first of all

let me show you this open AI API so if

I'm searching over here open AI API now

uh you will get it uh so let me open it

first of all explore the API and start

building so this is what this is my h

this is my openi API right so uh yes uh

I think we all have used this openi API

and even uh on this channel itself

you'll find out many video related to

this openai API in all and uh definitely

you can generate the API key you can

access the various model we have a

various model basically here inside this

uh aure inside this openi itself like uh

GPT GPT GPT 3.5 gp4 whisper Delhi

various model right now guys uh first of

all we have to see the differences right

because until unless we are not going to

understand the

differences there will be a confusion

okay so what I did I created uh like

one like here I written the differences

for all of you I think it is visible now

so a your openi versus openi so uh just

just try to read over here what uh what

I have mentioned so a your open actually

it is providing you the managed

infrastructure okay where it is

providing you all the security right all

the security and here you can see AZ

openi offers private networking reasonal

availability and responsible AI flood TR

okay now uh on the other hand we have

this open AI so if you will uh see

inside the open so it is like I have

written over here open itself is not a

secure okay so here this Azure open like

whatever Services it is providing to you

uh like whatever security Feature

alerting Feature metrix and all I will

come to that I will explain you in a

detail I have kep couple of more images

okay so yes those feature is there

inside the a open but if you're going to

use open only open you won't get those

feature definitely you can access the

model whatever model they are providing

to providing to you and you can uh use

those model okay inside your

infrastructure so whatever

infrastructure you have created with

whatever security compliances and all so

you can use over there there but you

won't be like get the so here actually

it won't be a manage service you are

doing it by yourself it's a custom one

right which you are doing from your end

and there you are consuming this open AI

API but on the other hand if you if

you're going to see this Azure open API

it is providing you the complete manage

service means it is providing the model

along with that security different

different matrixes alert alarm and all

and here you can see the last one is

what responsible AI content filtering so

responsible AI content filtering means

what so uh like no other harmful

activity which uh like if you are

performing any harmful activity uh with

respect to that model so they will block

you okay and yes uh they will take this

action immediately so that like you

cannot perform any unusual activity now

here uh the second one is what

functionality such as uh raising an

alert whenever suspicious activity for

instance changing of a primary key are

supported so it is providing you it is

providing you multiple key okay uh

actually it provide you two key two API

key so if let's say one key is going to

be exposed so immediately it will rotate

the key okay so it is having that a

particular mechanism so automatically it

will be done now other other other than

this azeria you will find out this

functionality like there is not

supported so it is highly likely that

data T happen means uh this open a

actually it is not providing you that

type of functionality it is just

providing the simple uh key and uh not

it is not providing you the other of

functionality okay it is not providing

the other functionality related to the

security and all now coming to the

security part so in the security part

see here I have mention so first one is

what multifactor authentication the

second is what a data encryption at rest

right the third one is what rbsc role

based access management you can create a

specific role for the specific Services

as your keyboard for for keeping safe

your keys and all okay Keys uh and

whatever like your important information

is there if you want to keep it

somewhere uh you can keep it over here

okay now the second next one is what

service end point so here private

endpoint public endpoint both endpoint

actually you can create and you can

expose it according to your requirement

I hope this thing is getting clear what

is the primary difference between this

Azure open and open AI now model wise so

it is provide the GPD engine GPD 3.5 GPD

3.5 turbo GPD 4 gp4 o also then Tex

embedding right and then Deli engine

then chat playground evaluation and

matrixes so in short uh I can conclude

it I can say here Azure open AI it's a

completely managed service from the

Microsoft this Azure open AI is nothing

it's a collaboration of azure and open

AI getting my point now this Azure open

I what uh like it is providing to you

it's is providing the many security

features security alarms and all

everything so I hope uh if someone is

going to ask you this thing in an

interview definitely you will be able to

clarify it now coming to the next Point

here so see so here if you want to uh

access any model inside this a your open

AI so first of all uh you will have to

create it so once you will click on this

create just do it just click on this

create and here uh you will have to

select the meth so that is what actually

I was telling you in the free services

uh like you cannot access this as your

open AI you want to read more in more

detail about the free services I think I

already shown you about it you can go

and check out now first select the

subscription so this is the subscription

which I have created for me then you

will have to create the resource Group

so as of now I don't have any Resource

Group so let me create the resource

Group over here so here it's going to be

crash H now uh let me click on this uh

okay and then here is a reason guys you

can select the reason according to your

requirement I will come to this reason

and pricing also because it plays a very

important role I will come to the

documentation of the AIO AI Services

there they have given this uh there they

have given the documentation related to

each and every service all right now uh

let me write the name over here so name

basically uh here I can write crash for

okay so crash course models so this is

what this is my name you can write any

sort of a name you can write uh you can

give any name over here then pricing

tier so automatically it will give it to

you what according to your subscription

so I took the standard subscription uh

they are having premium or like

Enterprise level subscription also

definitely can check out now off view

full pricing detail I will come to the

pricing detail guys now after filling

all this information what you need to do

you need to click on this next after

clicking on this next here U keep it by

default then again next and here no need

to do anything then uh here if you want

to check the resources you can check so

first is aure eii service second is

Resource Group so this two resources it

is uh like showing you over here now

coming to the next again and then uh

simply you it is first it is going to be

validate now once the validation will be

done you can create it over here so

let's wait for 1 minute okay now it is

done see guys so just simply click on

click on this create and here you can

see your deployment is initializing so

you can see your deployment over here

right hand side now uh until it is

getting deployed let me uh show you few

more things related to this as your open

AI so guys here uh see this is what uh

this the portal let me close it it is

not required as of now or simply search

about this a your AI service document

okay so once you will search it guys

here you will get this very first link

just click over here I'll just open it

let me close this this one so see you

will get the uh page okay you will get

this page where you will get get the

documentation related to each and every

service so here is aerop speech language

translator Vision custom Vision phase

content safety video indexing uh video

indexer Aur I search whatever you want

whatever you want they are providing you

the a documentation related to each and

every service now what I have to do here

guys see I have to open this

documentation as your open AI now uh

this is the documentation and here just

click on this model so this is all the

like details and all related to this AER

openi but uh later on I will come to

this Kota limit deployment types and all

everything so first let me show you this

model now once I will click on this

model guys just scroll down here and you

will get one table right so inside that

table you will get you will see that

which model is accessible in which

reason okay now uh here I have selected

uh East us this reason now inside this

East us what all model is accessible

just just see over here this GPT 4613 is

not there 0613 means what it's a date it

is representing a date okay 13 June so

this is the date and here is a month got

it now this gp4 is not accessible gp4

1106 this is also not accessible gp4

0125 this is accessible then gp4 Vision

this is not accessible gp4 turbo this is

also not accessible and here you can see

the list of the model OKAY related to

what related to the tell me related to

the reason so you can easy easily check

which model is accessible in which

reason now apart from this one guys here

if you will go and check with the

pricing so we will get the complete

detail of the pricing as well according

to the according to what according to

the reason so in which reason which

model is giving you how much uh cost so

if we're going to talk about this GPD

3.5 turbo

0.25 so this is the pricing of it in

like based on the input tokens so this

input token actually it is based on the

R so 1,000 token uh sorry 1,000 token

per minute actually you can uh process

okay within this price

0.5 so likewise you can calculate other

than this one I will show you the cost

calculator as well later on I will come

to that once I will explore the a AI

studio so there I have involved the cost

calculator also for the complete cost

analysis got it because that is very

much important now uh the next one is

what Legacy model so these are the

Legacy model different different Legacy

model assistant API code interpreter and

all now base model B Bas Lain and here

you will find out that fine tuning is

not available in this reason yes guys so

if you want to do fine tuning model you

cannot do in this particular reason

definitely I will have to change the

reason so let's try to check with some

other reason so here what I'm doing so

here I'm going to be click on this South

Central us let's see whether it is

available over here or not so here guys

see it is not available in this this

particular reason also north central

reason yes so inside this reason the

spine tuning is available now you can

simply check the price and here guys you

will find out the price is very very

costly of the fine tuning yes so weage

$34 training per computer hour and uh

here you can see the hosting price input

uses per th000 token so this is the

price for the per th000 token okay then

output use is per th000 token here is a

price now just see this price $34 $68

for what for this dpd 3.5 it is a pretty

much High guys because see whenever we

are passing the data to the model okay

so it takes around around okay minimum

if you are passing minimum 5200 rows on

now so it takes around like 30 35 to 40

minute I I already seen I already

checked and in that in between that only

you will get around $60 so this fine

tuning actually it is very very costly

right so other then this one I will show

you the rag like how you can create the

rag uh basically and rag is also like

not a cheaper one it is also very costly

because uh with the rag this database

cost is associated so we'll come to the

rag and we'll try to explore the rag as

well now I hope guys you got the

overview definitely you can check out

and according to your requirement you

can select the model and you can

calculate the price now one more thing

you'll find out over here if I'm going

back so here you'll find out the

deployment types so first uh let me

click over here on this deployment type

so uh the basic one is the standard one

okay now the next one is what provision

and the deploy and the global one okay

here is what here's a global global

deployment so generally actually we

going to use this standard only because

my pricing the subscription which I took

it's a standard one if I want to take

this provision so specifically I will

have to make a request for this

provision now I will show you what all

model is there inside the provision and

what all model is there inside the

standard and what a model actually

you'll find out inside the global reason

everything I'll be showing you where

over the portal itself now I hope your

all the basics is clear coming to the

next part so once you will open your

azer so here see it is ready simply

click on this go to the resources once

you will click on this go to the

resources guys here it is giving you the

different different option right no need

to go through with each and every option

as of now so here uh let me show you

which is the like uh necessary for you

so first is this key and uh Endo so this

I was telling to you that it is

providing you two keys right so yes uh

here is the first key and this is the

second key you can utilize any key so

for accessing your model so this is

called primary key and here is what

here's a like secondary key now you can

read over here these keys are used to

access your as your openi service do not

share your key right each and every

detail that like sharing with you we

also recommend regenerating the key

regularly you you can regenerate the key

also over here and one only one key is

necessary to make API call only one key

is necessary no need to use both key

over here then here's a reason so East

us we are working in this reason and

this is what this is the endpoint URL

okay so this thing is clear to all of

you now coming to the next one so guys

here if you will click on this model

deployment see let me click on this

model deployment and here see there's a

option manage deployment now they are

telling to you model deployment feature

have moved to the Azure openi Studio

okay so uh see here you won't be able to

find out this uh model deployment once

you will click on this manage deployment

so you will get one studio and that

studio is called a your open a studio

it's not Azure Studio that is different

one that's a different one different

service aurei Studio it is azure openi

studio so let it open and then I will

show you how you can access the various

model from here and how you can deploy

it and how you can create your own

custom chat engine if you are enjoying

the session guys please hit the like

button please mention inside the comment

section uh if you have any concern any

doubt or whatever in your mind guys so

see my a your openi studio is ready and

see there are different different option

now let me uh zoom in and see left hand

side you'll find out various option now

uh first guys uh what I can do uh let me

click on this model so what all model is

there so if you will check in the model

in the in this model section find out

the various model let it uh

load okay so these are the model guys

which is available in this specific

reason the reason is what the reason is

the reason is esus2 so see the model

version created at which day okay now

here stat is succeed and deployment yes

it is available for what for the

deployment okay so uh now guys apart

from this model one more thing you need

to check so guys here is a deployment so

I haven't deploy any model over here and

if I didn't deploy it guys definitely I

cannot use it so uh for the deployment

simply I can uh create a new deployment

from here and I can deploy okay that is

completely fine now EX in subscription

key or wrong in point make sure okay not

an issue let close it don't know why it

is giving to me now coming to the next

part here Chad so once I will click on

this Chad so this is what this is my

playground now here you will find out

two thing first is what first is chat

and second is completion so definitely I

will give you the differences between

this chat and this completion what is

the difference in between now uh here

one more is there Delhi is there right

Delhi I think we all know about Delhi

okay so here see it is telling to me

this deployment is successfully as soon

as I opened it and is like uh telling to

me your deployment is done if you will

go and check inside the model guys you

will find find out this uh sorry inside

the deployment you'll find out what

you'll find out this Delhi okay because

whatever model I want to use so first uh

I will have to deploy that model then

only I can use those model so

automatically it got deployed uh and it

will be uh it will happen for you as

well once you will click over here it

will deploy now I'm coming to the chat

completion API now inside the chat

completion API see uh here it is telling

to me you don't have any deployment see

Delhi is just for this one for this a

particular one but this Delhi is not for

of this one we cannot create an image

from here and similar to this one we

have this completion API so if you

remember guys uh I don't know you know

or you don't know see uh this open AI if

you will go and check with the open a so

there they have two type of API the

first is called uh chat completion API

and the second is called completion API

so completion API actually they were

using they will they were using inside

the previous version of the open AI I

think in 0.26 maybe 0.26 or 29 the open

a module you can simply check now this

chat completion API actually it's a

latest one okay and like still in the

latest version they are using this chat

completion API and I will be showing you

the code as well by seeing the code you

can identify it if you want to know more

about this chat completion and

completion API so it's see don't go with

the completion API always go with the

chat completion API but still you want

to know simply you can search that

completion API versus completion API so

simply you will get how many uh like

platform and all and even uh they are

explaining you over the uh like openi

developer Forum as well see here is a

complete detail so now this chat

completion API actually it's a latest

one and we're going to use it even over

the St overflow also you will find it

out so simply you can click over here

and you can read about it complete

details and all okay I hope this thing

is clear now coming to the deployment so

guys uh before deployment I would like

to clear one more thing over here so

that is nothing that's a quota right so

Kota or the type of the deployment

anything you can say now just click over

here and here once you will click so you

will find out we have a different

different type so different different

type means what so different different

type means standard provision okay

global standard other so different

different type right so now see whatever

model is there inside this standard okay

inside this particular segment I can

access all these model but whatever

model is there inside the provision for

this one I will have to make a specific

request okay or I will have to make my

subscription okay so I will have to take

this pay as you as you go plus one the

premium one then only I can access or

specifically I will have to make a

request for increasing my quota right

and yes definitely charges and all will

be associated with this provision if you

are going to purchase this subscription

if you have a standard subscription then

you can access these many model this

particular model now let me show you how

you can do it so guys once you will go

in the deployment okay now just click on

this create new deployment from here you

can select your model so let's say I'm

going to be select this uh GPD 3.5 turbo

so yes this GPD 3.5 turbo is available

for me inside this ex standard Cota now

this is telling to me because this fine

tuning is not available inside this

particular reason and because of that it

is giving me this particular warning no

not an issue I can close it I can ignore

it now uh see this deployment type is

what standard now other than this one if

I'm going to select any other model

let's say if I'm going to select this

dpd 332k now see it is uh coming to this

provision manage and here if you will go

if you will see this uh warning so it is

telling to me requesting for more Kota

just the existing Kota means I will have

to increase the Kota specifically I will

have to make a request for this

particular model so once I will click

over here I'll will be getting it so

I'll be getting the complete form okay

so yes you can fill out that form and

then you can raise your quota see once

you will go inside the provision and

which model guys this one now just click

over here this uh to this one so let me

show you just wait I think I can hide to

myself okay this one guys see here is

the option request Kota so once you will

click over here on this request Kota so

it will contact your Microsoft account

team to request provision through P Kota

okay fine so I think I will have to take

a advanced subscription for accessing

this particular model I believe this

thing is getting clear to all of you now

uh for some model actually you can

access from here itself so let's say if

I want to access this particular model

gp3 gp4 turbo uh let's uh see okay no

for this one also I think I will have to

make my uh I will have to like take a

advanced subscription got it so uh

whatever thing is there inside the

standard I'm going to use only those

particular model I believe this thing is

clear to all of you now let's make a

deployment of few models and let's start

to use it for our chatting purpose or

for the content generation and all so

click on the deployment and here we can

easily like do our work with our GPD 3.5

or Turbo as well and here in this

particular regon see in the standard

region this GPD 4 is also available so

yes we can use this gbd4 for what for

the images for the image related thing

now uh let me select first GP 3.5 turbo

and here I can write the deployment name

so this is going to my chat engine and

here guys see this is a token limit

token per minute uh rate limit so what's

the meaning of it token per minute rate

limit so in 1 minute actually how many

tokens you can proceed okay so you can

increase it according to your

requirement token means what the number

of words uh so inside one sentence like

how many tokens is there how many words

is there it is asking about to this one

right this second is one so

corresponding to this limit see if you

are going to increase the limit so this

limit is also increasing so this limit

actually RPM it is showing to you

request per minute okay so in uh 1

minute how many request you are making

right to your API so I hope this two

thing is clear it is pretty much

important now I'm keeping it low because

I for this practice I not required this

much of like RPM and this TPM I can

simply keep it 30,000 only that's it now

what I can do I can simply click on this

create and see my deployment is going on

so once I will deploy I can access the

model inside this chat section see now

apart from this one guys uh we can take

one more model so the model is what gp4

so which model guys gp4 Omni I'm going

to be select gp4 Omni because it is

available inside this ex standard price

so just click over here and then you can

write the name of the deployment this is

what your this is your Omni model then

uh you can select the PPM and RPM and

then finally you can create

so see your model is getting created and

now it's successfully deployed so what

you can do you can go inside this chat

and now you won't able to find out that

a particular issue so see this is what

this is my complete chat playground this

is my complete chat completion API so uh

if you want to select the model simply

you can uh click on this drop down I

think it is visible let me uh let me

switch off my video this one guys chat

engine in the deployment itself you can

see this one so once you will click over

here you'll find out this chat engine

and this Omni model this Delhi it is

only for this particular playground okay

it is not for this chat Playground now

uh what I can do I can use this

particular model so let's say I want to

use this chat uh engine simply I can

write my message hi and what I once I

will hit enter guys so here uh see it

will be generating one error and this is

not for me this is for the everyone so

whoever uh basically it is uh using this

particular model xess dened to invalid

subscription key or wrong API end point

make sure you provide a valid key for an

active

subscription and current API okay I

think I was getting this uh 5 minute

error because within 5 minute actually

they are going to be active this

deployment let me check with other

message

hello access deny due to invalid

subscription key or wrong API endpoint

is it wrong guys okay just give me a

second let me check

it so here guys you can see my uh chat

is working now my model is working what

was the issue so here I just restarted

my payment okay my subscription

basically whatever subscription I have

added and it is working I think there

was some issue with this uh subscription

method I just restarted it now you can

see it is active and if I'm going to

make a chat here I'm able to do so let

let me show you from scratch only so

this is what this is my model let's see

this is what uh this this three model I

have deployed uh let me open this uh

chat engine first of all I'm clicking on

this chat engine now click on this open

in playground so once you will click on

this opening playground and here uh it

is opening inside the playground itself

see directly now I can ask any questions

so I can say here uh hi tell me about

the uh Indian

Capital now see what I'll be getting so

I'm getting about the Indian capital I

can regulate my response as well so

first of all let me give you this entire

uh like overview of this entire

interface so what it is all about now U

see here you will find out this clear

chat option just click on this clear

chat and it will be gone now a

playground setting if you want to set

any uh setting over here anything right

you can do let's say language

subscription and all and there are so

many setting you can manage according to

your requirement I will show you the uh

like speech also like how you can

convert from piece to text like I will

show you the use of the whisper model

and that is in my pipeline only now let

me close it and then view code so here

you will find out the code uh the entire

code guys so by using this particular

code you can connect right you can call

this API using the python python SDK I

will show you this one uh like right

after this configuration and all so

first of all let me uh show you a few

more thing and then I will come to this

completion API chat completion API then

uh apart from this one left hand side

you can Define your prompt and all so

see here left hand side what you can do

if you have any sort of a template promp

template uh you can select from here

okay otherwise uh what you can do so

like don't select any sort of a promp

prompt template here simply you can

Define your uh prompt okay this is

nothing this is a behavior of your

system system behavior and then uh here

if you will go and check this code

inside the Json so you will find out the

complete detail who is replying who is

giving the answers and all everything

the role is system and here content is

what so content is what content is

nothing it's it is representing the

prompt now let's say if I'm going to ask

say something hi hello how are you so

you will find out that who is giving

this response so user is asking this

thing user this is the question of the

user and here uh this is the answer from

the system so system is my assistant

means my main model and here this system

actually it is representing to the

overall behavior of what over behavior

of the model I hope this thing is clear

to all of you now see here is what add

your data I will come to this one also

how you can create your custom

application how you can add your data

and then finally we'll deploy it from

here itself now one more thing so just

click over here uh and this one past

message include how many message you

want to include it is related to the

history let me show you uh regarding

which I'm talking about so see guys this

one pass message include now see the

option over here for what for the uh

like messages how how many message you

want to include then other than this one

here is a parameter so the different

different parameter Max response how

many you how many one actually you want

to get a response this is the maximum

one temperature means what the

creativity of the model here top P you

can read about this top P actually it is

also related to the creativity

probability and all related to the

generating word stop sequence if you

have any specific sequence where you

want to stop you can make you can write

over here frequency penalty what should

be the word what should be the fre

quency of the word that also you can

decide present penalty what you want

don't want to present present right okay

that specific thing also you can mention

over here so many things you can

regulate it is a complete uh API okay

chat completion API now uh this is clear

now coming to the completion API guys so

this is a previous version this uh

completion API is nothing uh actually

this is what this is the previous

version old version how we can check out

let me show you so let's say if I'm

writing High here and it will generate

the answer no no doubt no issue the

completion orientation the specified

model Delhi okay so it is saying that

first please change the model uh where

is the model guys this is the option for

the model uh chat engine is fine great

now finally I can check so let's see

whether it is generating or not so yes

it is generating now I think see it is

generating related to what what Rel to

the code uh I think I will have to

define the chat context from here like

let's say I'm going to be Define this

question answering so here what I can do

I can ask any sort of a question and

according to that is going to generate

answer how many NE are is there let me

generate it let's see what I'll be

getting it's it it is giving me a

predefined template okay now I can ask

my uh my question basically so what is

your name let's say so if I'm going to

ask any custom question definitely it

will be able to generate the answer so

no the model consider model modifying

your prompt and parameter to behavior

okay so I think guys I will have to give

in this specific format only means

related to this one only uh whatever

question whatever uh context they have

given likewise you can check but yes

again uh there is a chat board also you

can check okay uh so let's see what I

can ask over

here uh hi so let's see what I'll be

getting with this particular one no text

by the consider modifying your prompt

and parameter to improving the PRS okay

fine so I think guys uh we'll have to

check what I can do from here but yes uh

you can explore it and you can run it

now uh the main thing basically which I

want to show you over here that is what

there is a view code now once you will

go and check with this view code so you

will get the code and guys this code

actually it is uh representing to the

previous one okay the uh code related to

the previous version definitely you can

copy and you can check it

now uh coming to the next Point here see

Delhi so if I'm such if I'm writing

anything over here uh inside this prompt

let's say I'm writing uh give me a

image where where person or where boy is

cycling and girl

City behind him so this is what this is

my prompt now let me generate it and

let's see what I'll be getting

here will take some time and again uh

whatever images you are

generating like with it the price is

associated

okay fine so see guys how like uh like

they have generated the image so here is

a boy and the girl is sitting behind

this boy anything you can gener you can

download it from here you can delete it

and one more thing show code so just

click over here on this show code and

here guys you will get the code as well

now let's see how we can use this python

SDK right for accessing this model so

first of all uh these three things is

required first is what endpoint URL then

API key and then this code let me copy

this endpoint URL and see already I have

created this uh environment and all

everything so here my folder name is

what your openi crash course inside this

one this is my environment EnV here is

my file where where I didn't I haven't

written anything and this is my require.

txt file okay so what I'm doing I'm

creating one more file the file name is

going to be deli. py now inside this

del. py uh the first thing is what

endpoint URL so let me keep it this

endpoint URL and guys this is a

confidential thing so please don't

expose to anyone and after the session I

will also delete it so no one can access

it so here is what here is my endp point

URL I can do one thing I can create EnV

file also over here and there also I can

keep my confidential information and

directly I can read it inside by file

but as of now directly I'm mentioning

over here in front of you only now the

next thing is what API key so let me

take the API key also from where from

this code so I'm copying over here this

API key now perfect now the third thing

is what guys here I want to write a code

so this is going to my code now let we

copy it and here I'm going to be paste

it so this is my code now see guys here

uh we required what we required this see

this this will be default by default for

every uh like this will be by default

for every model okay this

24201 actually it is showing a model

date so you can check out also I think

it was visible inside this model section

this one model this one created date

okay so automatically by by default you

will get that date okay now coming to

the next point so here is what as your

end point so what I can do I can remove

this one and I can give my variable name

here so let me keep my variable name

then the third one is going to be API

key so let me remove this API key from

here and I can directly pass my variable

so here is what here is my API key now

coming to the next one so what we

required so here we required this open

AI so let me mention this open AI inside

this re. txe and and yes I can download

or I can install this require. txt

inside this particular environment don't

worry I will give you this all the

command related to do related to this

environment creation or this uh like

related to this re. txt download and all

I think many video many project you will

find out over here also on this platform

uh like from there easily you can learn

these things but I will give you all

these commands so here if install then

iphr requirement. THD so see uh this is

running and it is installing until what

I can do I can check whether everything

is fine or not so p is done then uh here

is API key grade so this is what this is

my method client image generate here I'm

passing my model name Delhi okay here is

what here is my prompt give me a image

where is a y great and N is equal to one

means the number of image so it will

provide me what it will provide me a

image URL so let me print this image URL

so image uncore URL let's see what I

will be getting over here so my

installation is done if you want to

check which version I have installed so

here simply you can check with the open

AI API open

AI Pi okay so just search about this

openi pii you will get the version of

this openi pii

130.3 now you can go and check inside

the release history also so the

completion API actually it was available

in 0. X okay

so it was available in this particular

version in this 0.28

0.281 so uh like from 1.x actually it is

not available you will find out this

chat completion API you can check out

you can go and check by U yourself as

well I don't have any issue so coming to

the point now so everything is fine I

can cross check also now once I will

write python over here so I can copy

this a your open and then I can paste it

so if everything is fine I will be able

to load it yes it is working fine for me

now exit and then I'm executing this

particular file so for executing this

file simply I need to write this Python

and this file name Deli do3 I hope it is

visible to all of you if not let me

switch off my camera so here see what I

need to write I need to write this Deli

3. py or deli. py only this is my file L

now see uh I'm running it and if

everything is fine guys it is going to

generate this URL at the end it will

provide me a image URL so it is calling

that API and after calling this API I

can access the image just wait just a

second great I'm getting my URL now just

click over here and see here is what

here is your image this one guys so

again like it has gener different image

because second time I'm calling it

and yeah I hope you are seeing the image

and you will be able to generate it also

now you can write a logic wherever you

want to save the image wherever you want

to generate a number of image but again

I'm saying cost is associated with it if

you want to check the cost definitely

you can check out you can go inside the

price section okay I think I already

shown you that uh where is a price this

one pricing now just go inside the price

section and check the price of the Delhi

the Delhi price is quite High

uh where is the Delhi Delhi Delhi oh

here is a Delhi image model is not

available in this particular region I

think I'm working in es us so see Del e

uh $4 for 100 images okay and $8 for

this particular configuration and for HD

actually $12 so this is the complete

configuration uh sorry this is the

complete pricing and all for what for

the delhi now I hope how to call this

python or how to call this openi API Aur

open API using this python SD now let me

revise this code so what we required we

required this endpoint URL and this API

key and you have to mention inside this

particular class okay we are creating a

object after passing this API version

means date then a your Endo here is a

endo and this API key this API key and

this is what this is my client now using

this client I'm creating this I'm

calling this image then generate and

finally I'm passing my uh like config

configure parameter and then finally I'm

able to generate the image okay now

similar to this one I can call the GPD 4

gpt3 model as well so let me write the

code inside this chat completion API so

what I'm doing guys I already written

the code let me give you this particular

code okay and then let's try to do it so

here guys what I'm doing see this is the

code now I have to remove this uh

python. EnV because we are not going to

use it as of now directly we are copy I

am keeping this API ke all over here

itself in inside the file so API version

is this one oh let me keep it by default

let me remove this uh API key and Ando

because it is from my previous code I

want it uh from my latest code so this

is what this is from my latest code let

me copy just a second here I'm going to

be copy it and after copying I can

simply keep inside my chat completion.

py so here is what tell me guys here is

my chat completion

sorry here is my AP endpoint API and

this uh endpoint API and this API key

now uh let me keep this endpoint API

over here so this is the one then I can

keep this API key over here okay perfect

so let me remove this unnecessary thing

if it is not required uh then I can

simply remove fine perfect so now

client. chat. completion create and here

is what what is my model name guys tell

me chat in

if you will go and check with the model

name so you'll find out chat engine let

me show you my model name so once you

will go with the mod deployment you will

find out your name chat e n g i n e that

spelling should be correct otherwise it

will give you the error e n g i n e

great now here is what here is my user

which is asking this question what is

the capital of Delhi so let's see

whether I will be able to get it or not

so I'm converting this completion into

what into the Json and I'm simply

printing it okay so let's see what I

will be able to get if if I'm running

this particular chat completion API now

uh let me switch on my camera so that

you can take the access of the entire

scam here I'm writing python python chat

completion py now uh it is generating

guys and if everything is perfect you

will get a response see here is what

here is my response in the content

actually this is in know Json form so

definitely you can extract the content

from here so just uh like write your

logic and you can ex the content so here

it is giving you the answer Delhi is not

a country so it is not having a capital

however New Delhi is the capital of

India so it is giving the correct answer

because we are using what we are using

tell me we are using the GPD model

behind so let me ask any other question

I can simply ask how many stars how many

stars in the universe so this is my

simple question guys let's see it's not

a simple uh let's see what this model is

giving to me so here uh I'm calling this

particular API python chat completion.

py and I'll be getting my answer so as

AI language model I don't have an

accurate answer to this question

according to estimate by scientist there

is potentially 100 billion star in our

Milky Way galaxy only and there are

billion of galaxy in the observ universe

however the exact number is Stars and

unknown great guys so yes my chat

completion API is working fine using

what using this python SDK now uh I hope

this uh thing is clear to all of you if

it is clear guys please hit the like

button and you yes you can write uh in

the comment section also sir everything

is perfect and everything is working

fine in my system also so now in the

next thing what I have to do see we

understood how we how we have to access

this chat completion API now uh if I can

keep my own document here and if I can

chat with that so how great it would be

tell me yes or no right so what I'm

doing so here I'm going to be add my own

data source okay so let's see guys if we

want to add our own data how we can do

that so first of all you need to click

on this add a data add a data sources so

just click over here and then it will

give you the various option just click

on this drop down and see here is a

Azure blob Azure AI search elastic

search URL web address upload file so

guys I'm going to be upload the file

from my local system so let me click on

this upload file and then here you can

see it is asking me a name okay so first

uh okay not name actually it is asking

me select a your blob storage resources

so first I will have to select the

resources as you can see it is giving me

an error because I don't have any Aur

blob resources I haven't created by

created it by myself so what I will do I

will click on this link which is uh

presenting uh by over here which is it

is representing over here now let me

click on this link create a new Azure

sources so I will be getting the page

and apart from this one it is asking me

about this AZ your AI search also okay

so this both thing I will have to add

over here so let me create this one as

well now uh create a storage account so

here you can see Resource Group this is

the subscription now I'm going to write

a name name for what name of this uh

storage account so name is going to be

crash codes

okay so this is going to be a name now

what I will do I will keep everything

same over here I'm not going to change

anything just click on this review and

create okay so once you will click on

this review and create first it will be

validating and then it's going to be

create this storage account now apart

from this one what I can do I can create

this AO AI search also so let me write

let me select the resource Group crash

course and here I'm going to write a

service name so uh let me write the

service name service name is same crash

course so this is my service name and

see the reason is what best us so keep

it by default and then create it now uh

here you will find out pricing tire so

standard uh basically 160 GB partition

per partition maximum 12 replicas

maximum 12 partition okay and maximum 36

suchar unit so it is providing you this

particular configuration for what for

your uh system for your chat for your

chatbot which you will be creating I

will be showing you how you like in some

time you you will get to know about it

so just create over here on this review

and create and then finally you can

create it so let is uh let it validate

and then finally you can create on this

create on create one so see my storage

is created you can uh go to the

resources and you can check and in

sometimes this will be also ready it is

a submitting the deployment now both I

can select over here so first let me

check with The Blob storage whether it

is coming or not just refresh it and

here see crash course is coming coming

now let me check as your need permission

yes you can provide the permission also

so it is asking about this term on

course for what for the uh like cross

reason so let's say if you have created

your storage in the west us and if you

want to access inside the East us how

you can do it it is giving you the

option let me switch of the camera see

turn on course just click over here on

this turn on course it will be done now

here is what a your AI search resources

just refresh it and you will get it over

here the Scrat course see this one now

you can write your index name index name

is what like where actually you are

going to be store your data okay that

particular index so here the index name

again what I can do crash course so the

same every name actually I'm going to

keep the same only so that I won't be

having any sort of a confusion now just

click on this next and it is asking

about the file so which file you want to

be store over here which file actually

you want to keep it over here now just

browse the file and here inside my Lo

system itself I have one file let me

show you so guys this is the file this

shoe let me show you what I have inside

this shoe file okay which I'm uploading

so let it uh upload the status is

spending until I can show you this shoe

file so I created it by myself it is my

custom file okay so here is what uh just

a wait let me open

it this is the file guys and inside this

file you can see there is a detail of

the shoe okay Nike ear XX plus sneaker

description of the shoe and then style

release date style code and every uh

detail actually you will find out

related to the shoe now the other one

also then three shoes I kept uh just a

small data so that it won't take too

much time for creating the index and the

final one because at the end it's going

to perform the similarity search uh I

will show you which uh search actually

is available over here here you won't be

able to find out the vector similarity

search you will only find out the

keyword similarity search okay so uh now

what I can do uh I I kept the file over

here so first of all let me close it and

then this is the file guys is spending

and upload file okay I think I need to

click on this upload file and it is

uploaded now just click on this next and

then it is asking about the Chun size so

chunk size what by default I'm keeping

one24 means my data is going to be

convert into this one24 Chun me inside

one Chun actually I'll be having this

much of tokens so uh now you can take

the search type so I only have this

keyword search over here I don't I'm not

having this eding search so that eding

search is available inside the Azure eii

Studio this is a your uh like this is

what guys tell me this is AZ your openi

studio okay and I will be showing the

updated version of it as your AI Studio

let on so just click on this next and

then here you can review your entire

detail and finally save the dogs right

so your dog is safe so see injection

process is going on and it's going to be

convert your data into what into the

Chun I don't don't have that much of

data so by default it will be taking

care of taking care uh take care of each

and everything whatever is there inside

the file so let it create and after

creating it guys what I can do I can ask

any sort of a question over here related

to this particular document it takes

some time it will take like one or 2

minutes so let it upload

guys now my data is ready now my index

is ready see here uh it is turning to me

data source is what so here is what

upload file name chunk size every detail

it is giving to you so what you have to

do first you have to check and then

finally we are going to be deployed so

how you can check simply you can uh

write your message and let me switch off

worry later on I'll be using this Azure

AI Studio which is updated version of

this AZ your openi studio and we'll try

to uh consume this Ando URL as well but

the South one in the South it is not

available this one guys now I can write

the name let's say the name is

what uh transcript okay I can generate

the transcript using the whisper model

so here I can write this transcript and

then pricing tier is a standard one now

uh this is already there now what I can

do my transcript let's see this is

working or

what I can do guys here see I can keep

my data okay so I'm going to create one

folder my folder name is what data and

inside this data folder I'm going to

a file over here whisper. py so what I

have I have my whisper. py now what I

will do so let me go to the resource

here and let me deploy the model just go

inside this model deployment manage

deployment and

request permanent limit it is by default

three keep it this only and then create

it deployment is creating guys here you

will get your whisper model now until

what I can do see here I'm going to be

access it using this python code so I'm

going to be write my python code just a

second let me give it to you so this is

got guys this is my complete python code

and here I required what I required my

data file so let me keep it and yes

everything is perfect see this is my

complete python code for what for the

whisper everything I will let you know

everything I will be explaining you one

by one now this load d.v is not required

here Json is required request is also

required I'm going to be remove this

particular part because I'm keeping

everything over here itself so first of

all guys see this whisper model name

Chad model reason is required okay

reason in which reason we are working

North Central us now along with this

whisper model we'll have to create one

chat model also so let me do one thing

let me create one chat model and that is

going to be GPT 3.5 turbo only so just

click on this create deployment and here

click on this GPD 3.5 turbo and you can

create it so let it create guys I think

it is done now uh we required couple of

things so first of all what you can do

you can select this audio to text and

open inside the playground once you will

do it you will get endpoint URL and uh

you will get what tell me you will get

the API key as well so scroll down here

and let's see whether it is there or not

oh I think you can directly pass the

data over here you can put it down and

you can check it is giving to you A View

sample code yes this is the code guys

maybe I'll be getting okay this is the

complete GitHub which they have

providing to you I required API key and

what I required the endpoint URL so just

a second I think I can get it

from homepage itself just a second

let's go back and let me check with this

particular model open AI

playground and if you will look into the

view code yes I'm getting over here just

copy it keep it over here this is going

to be in point URL and I required the

key also just copy the key from there

and here is a key then keep it over here

I require two thing guys this key and

this endpoint URL now both are done now

what is the name of this whisper model

so in my case the name is what audio to

text audio to text okay or video to text

whatever you can do now here is what

chat model I think this both are fine

let me cross check whether it is correct

or not just go back and you will get

your model name inside the deployment S

Audio to text and chat model both are

fine now uh reason name is also correct

So This is My URL okay so here I have to

create my fin URL so endpoint URL and

then whisper model name and this is my

complete URL guys I have to request to

this particular URL okay now here API

key where actually I'm passing this

particular key so this is my header and

URL I need to prepare this two thing now

I'm going to read my data so my data is

available over here so let me change the

name this is going to be data only not a

voice data my data is available inside

the data folder right I hope it is

visible to all of you this complete

thing then the next thing here is what

here is my data then I'm going to open

my file this particular file data file

okay I'm reading my data okay so here is

what here is my file and this is what

this is my uh like URL so here is my

data file which I'm passing over here

and here is my head header inside the

header actually I having a API key and

this is my final URL this particular URL

I'm requesting to this URL and I'm

getting my final response so this is My

URL guys okay which is being uh

responded now uh after this one see here

uh I'm getting my final response so from

this final response I'm generating a

text and here is what here is my user

prompt now what I'm doing so this is

going to my prompt me whatever we are

saying inside where inside the video

okay so that thing I'm able to get from

here from here itself then I'm calling

this a your open okay the chat model for

the chat model only see client chat

completion create and here is what here

is my chat model this which I have

defined because I have to generate the

answer now whatever we are saying in

inside the audio so if we are asking

about the Indian player name I'm passing

it over here this is my user promp okay

so see I'm passing it inside this chat

engine so uh this is my client guys

along with endpoint URL and key we are

going to configure we are calling this

chat completion API to the chat model we

are passing this uh system prompt and

here is what here is my user prompt now

finally I'll be printing the answer

let's see whether it is able to generate

the final answer or not here I'm going

to clear my screen and let me hide to

myself so that you can get the access of

the entire if I'm searching over here if

I'm writing here Python and python

whisper. py with. py oh let's see

whether I'll be able to get or not no

module name request okay fine so here I

can mention the request also inside the

re. pxd request is here it is request

now I can install it on my terminal so

pip install request q u

let's see guys uh whether I will be able

to okay so it is installing so finally I

can run my file so

python

whisper.

py it is saying file not found error I

think there is a issue with the file let

me check guys what is a issue with the

file whether it is correct or not so

here I'm going to be copy the path and

let me paste the complete path because I

think there's a issue with the folder

name uh here I'm going to keep it and

inside this

data the file name is what voice

mp. MP4 perfect guys I have my file now

I can put the double slash because it is

required in the windows system and here

is what here is my file guys okay let's

see whether it is working fine or not

now so Python with. py and here I'm

going to execute it list out all the

player name in the great I'm able to get

my text and see guys here is what here

is my answer I hope it is perfectly

visible to you now you can pass any sort

of audio file you can generate the text

from there using the whisper model and

here you can generate the answer using

what using your chat model I hope this

thing is clear to all of you now let me

summarize what all thing we have learned

so far so I'm going through with the pp

itself now uh we understood guys about

this Azure open a okay the complete

detail introduction and after this one

we have seen so how you can access the

Azure open AI so we have seen the

playground chat completion API different

different model gbd4 g3.5 I shown you

standard quota provision quota

everything pricing detail and all I hope

this is perfect now my next point is

going to be a function calling using a

your open a so if you want to make a

function calling how you can do that now

apart from this one fine tuning and this

a your AI studio so this will take some

time this a your AI Studio but fine

tuning and function calling it won't

take any time okay like that much time

let's start with the function calling so

guys let's try to understand the basic

and the fundamental concept of the

function calling and then we'll go for

the python implementation so here uh let

me open my Blackboard on my Blackboard I

kept one image and by using this image I

will try to explain you the fundamental

concept of the function calling so uh

here let's say my user is asking a query

so here is my user and he is asking a

query uh through the chat interface now

what is the chat interface guys so chat

interface uh it could be any UI UI of

the chatboard and QA system so here it

is calling okay so whenever I'm writing

a qu query it is calling to my openi API

through the chat completion API itself

so I'm going to be Define my chat

completion inside my Cod and then we are

calling this openi API now inside this

chat completion API I'm going to Define

one function okay so this function it is

extracting the information from where

from the user prompt so whatever prompt

I'm going to be defined So based on that

particular prompt it's going to be

extract some information and then it is

calling to some third party API okay and

then from there itself it is fetching

the information got it now uh I hope

this thing is clear but let's try to

understand it by using the example and

then we'll try to implement that same

example okay in the python code only so

uh let's say uh here is a user now this

user actually uh this uh wants to

understand or this wants to know about

the latest weather of the Mumbai now uh

here is what uh here I'm calling my GPD

model GPD uh let's say 3.5 now this GPD

3.5 it does not know the latest weather

of the Mumbai or any other city like

Delhi bangaluru bopal indor whatever

right now this uh openi actually openi

model it I don't know the like current

weather of the model so what it will do

guys so inside this one what I will do

so here I will be defining one function

now this function okay it will take this

location it will take this location and

after collecting this location what will

happen you know so it is going to be

called this third party API for what for

extracting the external information so

here I got the location let's say I got

the Mumbai now uh based on my code

whatever code I'm going to be write

whatever description I'm going to be

write based on that let's say it's going

to be called this weather API we e a t h

e r weather API okay now now this

weather API based on the location it is

providing me a information and then this

information is coming uh the response is

coming to my chat completion API itself

and finally it is going to the user

itself I hope the understanding is clear

to you now if someone is going to ask

you in the interview why we use this

function calling what is the use of this

open a function calling so simply you

can say that so this model this uh this

this particular model this llm model it

does not aware about with the it does

not aware with the latest information

okay or the recent information so those

information we can fetch externally from

outside and there this function calling

comes we can extract the like necessary

inputs from where from The Prompt itself

and based on that I can call my further

code for calling the external API for

fetching the information I hope this

thing is clear now let's try to

implement it in a python so here guys uh

let me do one thing let me so here all I

created one file function calling uh f c

okay fine this is fine now here itself

I'm going to write my code so uh let me

write the import statement import OS

then uh here I'm going to be import one

more module that is going to be a

dequest then from uh open here itself

I'm going to be open uh I'm going to be

import this as your openi so let me

import this as your open guys perfect so

I have imported this now now what I'm

doing I'm going to be create one method

method name is going to be main now uh

here inside this method uh what I can do

I can test it whether it is working fine

or not so I can simply write a testing

over here so let me write this testing

now what I can do I can call this

particular method so let me call this

method Main and here I can call it

inside this if condition so if a name is

equal to is equal to M okay now perfect

I hope everything is fine uh so what I'm

doing guys so first of all let me switch

off my camera so that you can get access

of my screen now what I will do so here

uh actually I'm going to be run this

particular file so simply uh I have to

write this python function calling uh

where I'm writing it guys just a second

what is happening let me open the

command prom I think that is fine now

let me write here python function call

great so if everything is fine guys I'll

will be getting my testing okay perfect

so I'm getting my testing now I have to

write my further code so let me write uh

the further code so first of all what I

have to do guys so I have to Define my

client uh I already shown you this uh

chat completion API right so from here

itself I'm going to take this client now

uh let me copy this CLI and here I'm

going to paste it inside my main

function got it guys now this client

actually it is required two things first

is endpoint and the second is what the

second is API key so let me Define this

end point and this API key over

here so guys this API key and endpoint

from where I will collect tell me

whatever model I'm calling okay uh so

whatever model I'm calling from my aure

open a so that particular endpoint and

API key I'm going to be paste over here

so uh I'm going to take it from here

itself so let me take this endpoint and

this API key I already shown you that

how to uh created all right this uh

model uh how to deploy it and how to

generate this endpoint and API key now

uh let me paste it over here so here is

what here's my Endo now this is what

this is my API key okay uh so I got both

now fine now what I will do so after

calling this one the next thing is what

I will be defining the function okay now

before defining the function let me do

one more thing Let Me call this chat

completion API over here so for the chat

completion API simply I can write here

client c l n great now I can write this

chat okay now I can write the completion

so here is what here is my completion

then dot create right so here I got my

create now inside this one I can mention

about the model so where is my model

guys here is my model now my model name

is going to be chat model I already

created it I think you know about it

then uh what I'm going to do so here I'm

going to be write the message so let me

Define my message over here my message

could be anything let's say my message

is this one I'm going to be copy and

paste uh this prompt which I already uh

created now with that I think uh the

idea will be more clear to you so here

is my message guys see I'm saying you

are assistant which is going to be

replying me a weather information and

then here I'm asking a weather of the

Bal okay I can mention any City and it

will provide me a information so instead

of Bal let's say I'm writing Mumbai over

here got it great so this is what this

is my uh chat completion API now let me

call it and let me check whether it is

giving me a response or not or uh what

it is giving to me actually now I simply

I can collect this thing inside where

inside this completion so let me write

over here this completion now uh what I

can do so let me uh get the output

further so here I'm going to be print

this Json that's it guys so everything I

took it I took from the previous code

itself and I haven't defined any sort of

a function over here now I will be

defining the function first let me check

what will be my final output so uh let

me clear my screen and here I'm going to

be call this function calling. py uh

let's see the output so here it is

telling to me missing argument model

model and Str Str okay so it is showing

me some error guys just wait let me

check line number

25 uh line number

25 then here it is telling to

me

create okay then missing required

message and

model St Str uh message and model maybe

I missed something guys okay messages

messages here the argument name is wrong

messages great uh now let me check

whether it is working or not great so

here I'm going to be run it again python

function calling and let's

see so see what I'm getting here

deployment message the API deployment

for this does not exist if you can

deploy within 5 minutes fine guys so

here I think this API is giving me issue

let me check whether it is correct or

not so what I'm doing I'm just going

through what through my aure API as your

open API uh not this one okay session

expired let me check guys fine I'm going

to be login again so here simply I'm

going to be write this as your open AI

just a second let me open

it here let me sign

in then I will be getting my Azure open

a fine then uh here is my crash course

model and this is for what this for the

transcript now now let me open this one

and here is my model

deployment and then manage

deployment now uh inside this one I'll

be having my models so let me check

whether it is there or

not great Telly chat engine Omni model

and everyone is every model is here now

okay perfect this is also fine now let

me open inside the playground

yes this is also I open now let me check

with the view code and here is what here

is my API sorry endpoint let me check

with the end point whether it is correct

or not I'm going to be paste it over

here I think it is same now let me check

with the op API key so I'm going to be

copy it and here I'm going to be paste

it guys this one if you want to keep it

inside the EnV file you can keep it fine

so this both thing are fine Now API and

all everything is perfect and the model

name is what

chat model so let me check guys model

name is correct or not so here we are

providing with a token name

now let me take the model from here okay

the model name is chat engine that's why

it was giving me a issue so let me

mention the chat engine here it is going

to be chat engine perfect guys n and my

spelling is also correct great now let

me run it and let me check whether it is

working or not so simply uh I'm uh going

to be clear the screen now let me switch

off the camera and see python function

calling. py

yes so fine I'm getting my output and

here you will find out so it is telling

to me I am sorry I'm a AI language model

and do not have a real access to the

current weather right and however you

can use device built in be app or search

online for the readable beather sources

so guys this uh

this particular code actually it is not

giving me a current weather as I told

you that it is not capable this model is

not capable so how we can do that so we

are going to be fetch this information

from the weather API okay so open a

weather API now let me write over here

open by the a map API so from this

particular API I'm going to be fetch the

information okay now here see once you

will uh scroll down so it you will find

out this current weather okay current

weather data now just do one thing just

uh click on this subscribe now once you

will click on the Subscribe here you

will get this free option okay free

option Now using this particular code

what you have to do you have to fetch

the current weather data now uh here you

require this API key okay for fetching

the data now just click over here on

this get API key now once you will do it

guys you will be getting uh this

particular page you can fill out the

information let me do it over here so

here I can write my username and uh I

can write my passport already I did it

guys so that's why uh it is uh not

asking to me I saved it and it is uh

giving me a directly now uh okay so I

think create account maybe I can

directly log in over here because again

it will give me a issue so just wait let

me log in directly I think I already

logged in and here is what here is my

API key just a second guys okay

so see guys if you haven't created

account you can create the account and

you can get it now let me click on the

sign in and here I can enter my email

and password great I sign it now here is

what here is my API key so this API key

will be required for fetching the

information for fetching the data okay

so uh if you haven't created account

guys first you will have to create the

account then only you can get this API

key now let me copy this API key and

here I'm going to keep it somewhere

inside my file only so let me open the

file and here I'm going to be keep this

API key as of now now one more thing

will be required guys I have to create a

URL okay a specific URL so uh let me

show you from where actually you can get

the URL so once you will go back so here

just uh click on this one current

weather just uh once you will click over

here on this current weather so see this

is the URL which will be required okay

so how to make an API call for getting

the current weather this one and and for

that you will be required this latitude

and the longitude and this API key API

key we have already collected and

latitude and longitude I will show

longitude I will show you how you can

get it so just copy this URL from here

and then keep it somewhere inside your

uh keep it somewhere inside your file

only so this is the second thing now one

more thing will be required see if you

want to get this latitude and longitudes

for that actually you will be required

the location by using that particular

location you can get this latitude and

langit longitude now just scroll down

here and there itself actually you will

be getting the option you will be

getting one more URL for fetching the

latitude and longitude okay let me show

you that as well so just scroll down

scroll down and here see guys city name

so once you will write the city name

means once you will write a location so

what you will get you will be getting

the uh latitude and longitude of that a

specific City just copy it and keep it

over there I'll be showing you how to

call each and everything after defining

the function and all so uh I'm going to

be keep it inside where inside my file

itself got it so this three API so this

three thing now what I can do I can

replace this uh API key okay or what I

will do directly I will be pasting

inside the code itself and you will be

getting now one thing I haven't talked

about the function okay so first of all

let me Define the function so that

function basically it will fetch the

location from where it will fetch the

location from The Prompt itself right

right and then we are going to be pass

that location over here to the city name

and based on that I'm going to fetch

this latitude and longitude and finally

I'll be generating my current weather

based on my query getting my point now

let's try to perform it so uh let me

create a function guys so I already

created a definition of the function I'm

giving to you and here uh this is the

definition so inside the definition the

first name is what the first thing is

the get weather this is the name of the

function

here is the description of the function

okay description is what you can see you

are you have to retrieve the time

information data about a particular

location and place simple uh description

now parameter this is very much

important guys this particular parameter

now see uh here in the parameter

actually we have given this location so

this is going to my parameter and this

parameter I will be fetching from where

tell me this parameter I'll be fetching

I mean this location I'll be fetching

from The Prompt itself automatically it

will take it or automatically uh like

whenever we are going to be Define a

function it will collect it from the

location itself or if we are going to be

Define the a few short prom okay let's

say we are going to give a description

and based on that I have to fet some

information so that uh thing in that

specific manner I will have to mention

over here okay with those specific

parameter so later on I'll be showing

you that particular example as well but

over here I hope this thing is clear

this is a simple this is a simple

function definition so which thing we

required we required this location okay

so function calling is done now coming

to the next part so here I have to write

a code for what tell me I have to write

a code for the uh latitude and the

longitude so first I will I will be

giving the city name means the location

uh which I'm fetching from where from

The Prompt itself using this function

and then I'm going to be pass it to this

latitude and this longitude okay so uh

one more thing guys I told you that over

here inside this completion API I have

to Define the function also so let me

Define the function so here is what here

is a function parameter and which I'm

going to be defined inside my completion

API fine so everything is perfect

everything is clear now coming to the

next part now if we want to collect okay

if you want to collect this uh latitude

and longitude so we'll have to write the

further code so first of all let me

remove this print statement as of now it

is not required now just focus guys so

here is my code okay I already return it

let me give it to you this particular

code and one by one step by step I can

exper you so uh see uh this is the code

guys okay just just focus now and I just

just try to understand each and

everything whatever I have written over

here okay now the very first thing so

let me align this entire code and uh I

have to write it down just for saving

the time and uh let me explain you this

one this is a specific function for

fetching the data great guys fine so

let's uh discuss this particular

function okay so let me switch off my

camera so that you can get the access of

the entire screen and here let me remove

this also fine now just focus here so

first of all guys what we are doing see

we are going to be uh load this input

okay sorry this output whatever output

I'm getting from where from this

completion API okay so here uh what I'm

getting tell me I'm getting the output

and this particular output I'm going to

be defined inside this initial output

okay inside this particular parameter so

I have this Json let me check whether I

have Json or not so here I have to

import the Json got it so this is my

Json now see here is what here is my

initial output which I'm getting now

from this particular output I'm going to

be def I'm going to be F the location

okay so I'm getting a location over here

I'm seeing over here okay if location is

exist so please do let me know the

location I'm simply printing it and then

I'm going to be call it okay I'm going

to be call what I'm going to be call

tell me I'm going to be call this get

weather method so here to this get

weather method I'm passing this location

okay now based in this location based on

this particular location what I am

getting I'm getting uh my response okay

once I will hit this particular URL and

from this particular response I can

collect the latitude and longitude based

on my location only so I'm printing my

latitude and longitude also and then

this is my final URL uh with the

latitude and longitude and based on this

latitude and longitude we are going to

fetch the tell me guys what we are going

to fetch we are going to fetch the final

response and here we are printing uh

this particular response getting my

point yes or no guys tell me I hope this

is clear now uh here in front in place

of this particular URL whatever is there

so previously I was testing with the API

it was working fine so I have I had

generated this URL now let me remove

this URL and let me put mine whatever I

have created so first of all let me keep

this API key so here is my API key I'm

going to be copy it and I'm going to be

keep it over here that's it now the next

thing is what so over here after keeping

the API key guys what is required tell

me so here the location is required uh

so this side also I can mention the API

key perfect guys let me keep it inside

the double code great now uh here city

name so city name actually I can replace

with the location so let me keep the

location over here this one and here

perfect now what I will do I'm going to

be concatenate this particular string

this one and this one guys so let me

keep it like this great and here this I

can keep inside the double code okay

perfect and here I can keep this

particular value inside the double code

so that is going to create my entire URL

okay so I can remove this uh this one

because it is not at all required fine

so this is my complete URL which I got

now simply I can copy and paste it over

there because I want it with this

particular API key so here is my URL let

me remove it first of all and perfect

guys this is my latest URL now same

thing I have to do with this one also so

first of all let me remove this uh last

one because I already pasted and here I

require this latitude and longitude so

let me keep this latitude and longitude

because I want in a Str strr form so

here is

my latitude okay great now what I will

do I'll be keeping it over here and then

inside the double code that's it so this

thing I'm keeping inside a double code

and now plus and then s Str longitude

okay I have to create a URL in this

particular form only so that's why I'm

doing this each and everything now uh

this is my SDR longitude now I'm going

to be click on this plus and perfect

guys so I got my this URL as well fine

so I'm going to be keep it inside the

double code yes perfect so here is what

here is the uh longitude and now let me

keep the latitude also guys just a

second uh so here is what here is my let

SD uh weather is here weather and then s

Str perfect guys so this is going to be

my latitude okay so just a second I

think I did it wrong now let me keep it

over here that's it guys perfect so uh

now let me cross check this particular

URL whether it is a correct or not and

here for this one I can simply check

with my WEA open AI so weather open Ai

and this is the one just give me a

second and I'm finally going to call it

so here is the lead guys so this is the

thing basically which I was missing

after the weather and please check out

with the original one if H something is

missing or something is there perfect

guys so this is my complete URL now I'm

going to be copy and paste where tell me

over there itself so here is my URL so

let me remove it

and this is going to my

request perfect and yes so see guys I

have pasted my URL with the API key and

all everything so let me remove it and

then everything is fine everything is

perfect so uh let me revise the code

once and then I'm going to be execute it

and we'll get the weather from the

different different cities and all so uh

first what I did I defined this main

function this is my endpoint key key

endpoint and this API key this is my

client okay and and by using this client

I'm going to be create this chat

completion API there this is my model

and here is what here is my message then

I have defined the function for what for

fetching the information from The Prompt

itself so this is my function and here

I'm fetching the location and based on

this location okay I'm going to be fetch

the uh like necessary information okay

so here I'm going to be F the location

from where from this particular response

and then uh based on this this

particular location I'm going to be

called the open weather map API and here

is my final weather so let's see whether

it is working or not so first of all I'm

going to be clear my screen just a

second CLS and then let me call this

python function calling.

py great guys so let's wait and

check fine it is telling to me uh Json

decode Json coder expert value line

number one okay at which line I'm

getting error guys let me check over

here line number 65

line number 65 okay and then line number

42 maybe I missed something over here uh

line number

42 Json

loads and here is what function

argument great guys this is perfect Now

function argument is the location

itself okay wait guys let me check what

is the issue so here guys you can see we

are getting our output so what was the

issue so ISS issue basically it was was

with the model so here there what I did

uh I just changed my model means I

redeployed that particular model and now

I'm getting the output because uh see

I'm passing the input uh prompt to the

model and it was not able to generate

the final output this uh sorry not final

one this initial uh like output this

initial response and because of that it

was not able to decode this uh Json

basically that's why it was generating

the issue so what I did I did nothing I

just like uh redeploy the model maybe it

was not able to connect and now I'm able

to get my answer so let me show you how

it is going to work I will give you the

entire code and in a similar way you can

test if you are getting the same error

which I am getting in that case you can

restart your model or you can delete the

previous uh deployment and then you can

redeploy it and then finally uh it will

give you the answer so uh let me check

with the other location over here so

here uh I tested with the Bal uh here

let me write the Delhi so after writing

a Delhi I can uh write over here this

python function calling now see uh once

I learn it guys here you can see the

city name is Del latitude is this one

longitude is this one and here is the

weather condition so the weather

condition is has now uh see if you want

to uh if you want to know more

information about the weather you can

get it so here it will give you the

complete and a detailed information

about the weather I'm just going to be

check the like type of the the weather

the weather condition which I'm going to

be uh collected from here and finally

I'm printing it that's it but if you

want to get a like a temperature cloudy

this that whatever right so here you'll

be able to find out inside this

particular variable now uh what I can do

I can show you so I can I'm going to be

print this final response so that you

will be getting what all information

actually I can get with respect to the

weather so uh here uh again let me run

it python function calling. py and uh

now see it is Delhi ltitude longitude

great and see guys here weather

condition is has but apart from this one

it is giving me each and every

information so here's is the description

now humidity pressure temperature

temperature minimum feace like okay

every information so uh see guys over

here uh you will be finding out finding

it out for the console itself I hope

this thing is clear now uh what we can

do so we can understand the next module

now in the next module guys let me go

back to the uh let me uh go back to the

PPT so we are done with the function

calling in the next module I'll be

showing you this fine tuning so the fine

tuning first we'll select the model then

we'll prepare the data and then uh we'll

do the cost analysis so uh here guys I

will be doing the cost analysis and on

top of it I'll be performing the fine

tuning because the cost of the fine

tuning is very very high and it takes

lots of time as well so here definitely

I'll be guiding you related to this one

and finally we'll be starting with the

Azure open a sorry AZ your AI studio so

let's start with the fine tuning so

before starting with the fine tuning

let's try to understand the fundamental

concept of the fine tuning so here guys

uh let me show you my Blackboard and

over my Blackboard what I kept I kept

the different different model and

related to those model you find out the

parameter so uh let's look into the

parameter so this GPD 4 uh it is having

around

1.70 1.76 trillion parameter now this

GPD 3.5 is having 175 billion parameter

GPD 3 it's having again 175 billion

parameter now here you can see some

other model as well so this Bard is

having a 345 million parameter this a

t511 billion parameter okay uh let's

look into the Jimmy model So jimy Pro

it's having around 175 billion parameter

now this llama right so we have a

different different variants of the

Llama like uh 2B sorry 7B 13B 17b so it

is representing to the parameter only

now first of all we need to understand

the meaning of this parameter so let me

write over here this a parameter is

nothing guys this parameter is uh called

bits and biases okay so bits and biases

itself is called called what it's called

the parameter now whenever we are

talking about the model guys so here let

me write the model or let me write any

sort of a model let's say here I'm

writing this GPT or maybe jimy so this

model actually they are using

Transformer as a base model I think you

know about the Transformer right this

attention all you need research paper uh

you can check out with that research

paper you will get architecture of the

Transformer there you will find out the

uh inside the Transformer architecture

you'll find out the neural network there

are various stages of the Transformer so

first is uh embedding okay encoding Ming

then uh there is a multi detention and

then from the multi attention it is

going through the neural network itself

and then uh the normalization layer and

all everything so uh inside the

Transformer actually you will find out

the neural network and this neural

network actually uh it's a collection of

what weights and biases so this weights

and biases is nothing it's a trainable

parameter this is what this is trainable

parameter now just think over here if we

are saying three uh so if we are saying

like 175 billion parameter so what would

be the size of the architecture okay now

if we going to if we going to train

these type of architecture so how much

time it will take it's a like a very uh

typical question okay so like no one can

answer uh other than that person who has

trained the actual model so here we are

talking about the llm model which is a

very very huge which I just shown you so

it is having a lots of parameter like

bits and bies it is called the trainable

parameter and this bits and bies is

nothing it's a part of the neural

network only whenever we design the

neural network there actually we connect

this input layer to hi layer with a bait

and vises and Hider layer to Hidden

layer with a bait and biases okay so I

hope this thing is clear to all of you

now see guys let say we have train our

model on top of one specific data uh

what I did uh let's say this is what

this is my GPD model and this particular

GPD model I train on various data so

here this is the entertainment data now

this is the sport data okay now this is

the politic data now this is the

historical data of various data from

where from the internet and now it is

capable to answer related to this

particular data related to each and

everything now tomorrow guys let's say

there are one more data which came so

here uh one more data is related to what

uh related

to

Indian

election 24 okay so here guys see let's

say tomorrow uh we came with a we came

up with a new data and I want to ask

something okay I want to ask something

as of now see my model is just is just

train on this e-commerce data or uh

basically this uh uh basically this

particular data right Sports and this uh

politics and history and all but it

don't know anything about this Indian

election 24 so uh let's say if I'm going

to ask any sort of a question that who

will Who will win the election in 24

right so who

will win the election in

India in in 24 so this is my simple

question to my model now will it be able

to answer this question tell me will it

be able to answer this particular

question no it cannot answer to this

question why because it don't know

anything about this particular data we

haven't trained it we haven't trained my

model on top of this data okay so my

weights and biases actually it don't

know anything about this particular

information so what I can do so in this

case I can perform the fine

tuning fine tuning actually what it does

see so here we will be passing this

particular data so again this weights

and biases means in short I can say

parameter so my parameter actually it's

going to be adjust okay my parameter

this parameter is going to be adjust and

now if I will ask this particular

question to my model definitely I will

be getting the answer why because now I

have retrained my model on top of this

data I have adjusted my parameter this

bits and biases and now I can ask the

question related to this particular

information getting my point and this

retraining okay additional training

additional training it is called fine

tuning I hope this thing is getting

clear to all of you now let's do the F

tuning of the GPD model using this aure

open AI first of all what you have to do

guys you have to open your Azure open AI

uh a studio now inside this one just go

and check with the model so here you

will find out the various model and this

is all the pre-trained model which

someone has St and we are using just

click on this create a custom model okay

now here you find out it is telling to

you this fine tuning is not available in

this particular reason and I think I

shown you initially that uh you can

check the reason in which reason fine

tuning and all which is available so

what you can do so here uh simply you

can uh go and check with the

documentation let me show you again uh

so this fine tuning is not available

inside this East us uh but I have

created one more a your openi service

with the c uh with a South Central us

okay I will show you that just a second

so let it load or what I can do uh here

actually I can just wait so let me close

it first of all and I'm going to be open

one more as your open Ai and with that

basically I can show

you oh just a second I think my Internet

is

slow great guys so here I have opened my

Azure up here I I opened my Azure portal

now let me open this Azure open Ai and

here I already created two service so

this is my first service which is inside

this East us and the second was inside

the nor North Central us sorry I was

telling the South Central but it is

inside the north central us once I will

open it so here you will find out uh

there is a model deployment now just

click on this manage deployment and then

uh okay until I think it is loaded now

okay fine so I got it so see inside this

particular section SE this fine tuning

is not available we uh inside this fine

tuning model and what is my reason my

reason is the East us so what you can do

just click on this drop down and then

select this South Central USC still we

are not able to get the fine tune model

whatever model basically which I can

find T so just again click on this drop

down and select on this uh select this

nor Central us now see guys we are able

to get this model okay which I can find

you so web with the

$34 okay D in with the $40 uh GPD 3.5

turbo $45 GPD 3.5 turbo $68 got it now

uh what I can do so first of all let me

show you how you can f tune how you can

start your F tuning process and then uh

we'll perform we like calculate the cost

and all what might be the cost okay the

minimum cost so first of all see we are

inside this particular location north

central us now just click on this model

and then create on this custom model now

here there is a various uh stages okay

various stages which you need to fill

out so first you need to select the base

model so here you have a b DaVinci and

the different different variant of the

GPT and this GPT 4 now what I'm doing

I'm selecting GPT 3.5 turbo and here you

can decide your model suffix if you want

to add something it is optional only so

let's say here I'm writing uh my fine

tune latest right so this is what this

is my suffix means at the end of the

model I will be getting it now just

click on this next so here it is asking

about the data so I already kept the

data guys let me do one thing let me

remove this data I'll be showing you

from scratch okay so I'm going to be

close it here is what here is my data

file and then let me delete this data

file fine great so again I'm going to

the

deployment and then custom model here

actually I deleted it why I will show

you uh basically why I uh stopped it I

will letting you know oh let me delete

it from here as well so perfect this was

my previous job which I was creating

okay now custom model and here is what

base model this is my

suffix my find un latest great now what

I can do so here I can click on this

next now it is asking me about the data

so how you going to provide the data

there's a three option choose from the

existing file which was there but I

deleted it now upload the file from

local and here is what as your blob or

other shared web location so from

anywhere you can keep the file now what

I'm doing so just click on this browse

of file okay I'm uploading it from the

local itself and this is my file now see

here the here the extension of this file

should be Json okay do Json L getting my

point so uh let me uh do one thing let

me check with the Google itself in front

of you so here I'm searching about this

Json L okay Json l file so this is the

specific file okay Json lines actually

it's the extension of the Json only

which this uh GPD model is using okay it

want the data in this specific format

only in this Json lines now let me show

you where I kept the data so I kept the

data inside my local system inside my

local system only I created one folder

find model uh and inside this one I have

my data so let me reveal it inside the

file explorer itself so this is my data

guys inside this fine tune folder test

do jonl okay Json L Json line now I'm

going to be open it inside the notepad

and see guys so if you will look into

the data so guys this is very mandatory

and necessary thing please be careful

here you have to keep your data in this

specific format only okay this is here I

have kept 10 lines because one more

thing if you're providing uh less than

10 line okay here is a 10 10 line

basically inside my data if you're

providing less than 10 line in that case

it won't accept it means the GPD model

it won't accept it it will reject it so

inside your data there should be minimum

10 lines okay let let me show you one

line uh so what I kept over here so what

I'm going to do I'm going to select this

line completely and here after selecting

it I'm going to be open my Json viewer

let me open my Json viewer and there I

am searching or sorry there I'm pasting

this particular line so here is my line

right now format so see guys so this is

the data okay in this specific format I

have to pass the data first is what

first is the role so here I'm defining

the role of the model so I'm saying you

are a customer support agent for the

smartphone company who who whose primary

goal is to help user with the issues

they are experiencing with their

smartphone you are friendly and concise

you only provide factual answer to the

query and do not provide answer that are

not related to the smartphone right

because I want to train my GPD model on

a specific data okay on a smartphone

data which maybe don't know so let's say

if I'm going to ask anything to my GPD

model into the smartphone and if it is

not able to answer I can train it

specifically I can train on train it on

that particular data and that is what

I'm providing over here so the first

thing you have to provide the data in

this specific format and the second

thing is what

at least 10 line inside your data the

third one is what the extension should

be Json L Json line got it so perfect

and here is what here is my user user

question and this is the answer so uh

yeah now what I can do I can uh upload

the file which I already selected now

after uploading the file see it is

getting uploaded I can simply select

it it is in progress

guys great I got my file now just select

it okay done then just click on this

next and it is asking about the

validation just select this file great

validation is done Okay now click on

this next and here these are the like

some option which is which it is giving

to you how many number of epo you want

to run in number of epo EPO means what

forward propagation plus back

propagation that is called one EPO so uh

if you will go and check with the custom

one you will find out you can increase

the number of AO by default actually is

two only now B size if you have lots of

data if you like would like to uh

provide the data in the batches as of

now there is only one batch means we are

providing the entire data but if you

want to increase the B size you can do

it that is also possible now our

learning rate like multiplier so yes

that is also like you can you can like

put and here you can uh Define the seed

value also okay so these are the thing

basically which I'm keeping by default

only and here I I'm going to be click on

this next and see this is the like final

information and then you can start your

training job now once you will click on

this training job so here see guys it it

has started with a fine tuning so this

is what this is my fine tuning progress

now let it complete and uh I won't

complete it guys because it's going to

be charge you a lot and I don't want it

and guys uh believe me not even charge

it will take the time as well so if I

want to get this particular model so the

charge this uh trading time it will take

around 30 to 35 minute and after 35

minute I'll will be getting the model

after 15 minutes so this is a 1 hour

effort okay 1 hour process with a 10

line only just just think guys how big

the model is and how much time it will

take with a like just a small it's just

like with a 10 line only if you are

passing like 100 line or 150 line so it

might take uh maybe 2 Hour 3 Hour 4 Hour

it depends on the data only so here

first of all let me calc the cost and

then uh I think this is done uh so yeah

then I will be stopping the stopping

this particular process and see after uh

like training this particular model so

you'll be getting it over here itself

okay inside your model then definitely

you can uh deploy it and then you can

use inside your chat engine or else you

can consume it inside the local in a

similar way we are going to be we are

consuming the other model getting my

point so on let me repeat it once you

will uh like train this particular model

okay so you will be getting over here

along with all the model you can deploy

it over here inside this section and

then you can utilize it directly inside

your playground or else you can access

it inside your local system as well

using the get completion API fine now uh

let's discuss about the price and all so

let's say I have decided this particular

model so the price is what training per

compute R is what 45 tell me guys

$45 so here I am going to be open My

Epic pen uh let's try to calculate some

sort of a price so here guys let's

say um

great perfect so uh let's say guys here

the price for the per computer R is what

$45 okay so if we going to talk about

here or instead of this one I can open

my calculator just a second because I

think it is giv some

problem $45 for the per computer let's

say if I'm going to be uh if my process

going to be for the half an hour so you

can uh divide it by two itself so there

will be around 23 okay now apart from

this one here hosting per hour let's say

I'm going to be hosted for the uh this

particular model for uh let's say 2 hour

okay so here uh what is this tell me $3

so here I'm going to be add more $6 now

apart from this one see input uses per

th000 token so this is fine this is are

very less charges I can add $1 more so

here around $30 so if I want to use this

model if I just want to test it in that

case I will have to pay at least $30

guys okay where I'm and where I'm

calculating the training time just for

half an hour let's say if I'm having a

huge amount of data in that case uh it

will take around

like 2 to 3 hour or maybe more than that

so the charge is going to be very very

huge and guys you won't believe me I got

$120 will within half an hour only so

that's why I'll be sto sorry $120 will

within one and a half hour okay so

that's why I will be stopping the

process and yes uh rest of the thing is

fine now if you want to calculate into

the Indian rupees so simply uh what you

can do 30 into let's say I can take 883

only so $1 is equal to 83 RUP now here

is the prices around

2.5k right rupia so that will be a price

for what for the fine tuning just for 1

hour that's why I was saying it is

costly and I think you got to know the

process of the fine tuning so let me

stop it because it is going to be run uh

now here see here you can see inside the

notification and all it is creating the

fine tune model now uh here I can delete

it so so perfect it is not at all

required so yes I hope you got to know

about the fine uni now let's try to

understand the next thing uh let me open

the PPD itself so now we'll be talking

about this a your AI Studio

guys now in this Azure AI Studio guys

first we'll start with the Azure AI Hub

I will create the Azure AI Hub and the

other resources then uh I will deploy

the model or I will see that how I will

show you that how we can use the model

from the AZ openi directly from the AI

also you can connect okay inside this

azui studio we'll create our own rag uh

mean means our custom rag and uh then uh

here we going to steam like the entire

pipeline using this promp flow it is a

very amazing Service uh which is being

provided by the aori studio then we'll

create an endpoint URL okay means I will

deploy the application finally and we we

will be consuming it inside our local

application so here we're going to

create one flask application and there I

will show you how you can consume this

endpoint URL okay now before it starting

with this Azor EI Studio you should be

aware about this azori studio guys so uh

what you can do you can check out with

the uh Microsoft itself with the

official page of the Microsoft now just

see uh what they are saying about this

Azure AI studio so Azure AI Studio it's

a unified platform for developing and

deploying generative AI application so

if you you want to create generative

related application if you want to

deploy it okay so this a plateform will

help you from starting to end it's a

unified it's a single platform for

everything and it's pretty amazing guys

definitely you will get to know once

I'll be showing the entire functionality

of this a AI studio now you can check

the overview so inside the overview they

have mentioned explore the model craft

it then design it then roliz is okay so

you can uh like like like get a

evaluation and all evalution metrics and

all at the single place after deployment

and all then uh here you can see the

benefit so what is the benefit it is

going to be improve the customer

experience it is reducing the

organization risk okay improve work

quality and then enhance productivity

and all capabilities so yes uh these are

the capability you can build your own

co-pilot Enterprise check okay that we

are going to be create here incorporate

multimodality means you can uh like keep

all the models the different different

type of model and one very amazing thing

I will show you and you will literally

Sol so uh okay just wait I will be

showing you that now analyzis spe yes

you can analyzis the speech also so yes

you can go through with it and pricing

and all everything they have mention and

yes definitely you will be able to get

each and everything now coming to this

AO AI studio so for that what I will

what I have to do first I have to open

the Azure portal so I'm going to be open

the Azure portal inside the new new uh

like uh inside a new

browser new window guys so this is what

this is my a portal now let me click it

and here guys just a second let me do

the sign in and this is what this is my

a portal okay great now here what I will

do I will simply search this a your AI

Studio okay so let me search over here a

your

AI Studio got it now after searching

this azui studio I'll be getting this

particular page so I already created

this my chatbot my project this uh to

basically but here in front of you I'm

going to create it from scratch okay so

if you want to create this azer UI

studio so for that first you have to

create this Hub new a your Hub and

inside that you're going to launch this

studio okay so just click on top of this

new a your AI Hub and after this one it

will ask you some sort of information so

first is what first is a subscription

the second is a Resource Group we're

going to use the same Resource Group

which we have created then reason is

what uh East us only okay name you can

write any name let's say here I'm going

to be write

crash course and uh here uh see friendly

name is the same you can change it also

then default project resource grou okay

so this is what default project resource

grou now uh after this one it is asking

about the aure AI service for the base

model so uh See by default actually it

is creating a new service new service

for what tell me for the base model for

the openi model but already we have

created that service right I told you

now that we can connect with the

previous service also so we can connect

it over here now just click on this drop

down and select this crash course module

see there is two one is my audio

transcript and this crash course module

I'm going to select this crash course

module now let me select it and then

review and create and see guys it is

getting reviewed and then I'll be

creating it now I'll just wait and the

surprise is for all of you and here the

surprise is going to be uh let me show

you that so once I will create it so

after creating it see the deployment is

getting initialized and uh after this

one after the deployment and all I will

be able to access my a your AI Studio

okay so let's wait uh let's wait for a

minute I think it will take around 30 to

40 second or maybe one or 2

minute so yeah it is uh getting prepared

now

so see guys still is creating and once

it will be done I'll be getting the

resource option see by default actually

it is creating these particular

resources okay by default I'm not doing

it automatically so one is the key w we

are actually is going to be save all the

keys and all the second is what second

is a storage account okay so

automatically it's going to create a

storage account that blow blob storage

account which I shown you right

previously so yes I can utilize this

particular account and I can keep my

data over here so with every Azure AI

Hub okay with every Azure AI studio uh

this resources will be connected one is

what one is this uh like Vault second is

a storage third is this Azure open Ai

and the fourth one is the Azure AI

search that I will show you whenever I'm

going to be create an index and all uh

at that time it will come now see it is

ready so simply you can create on this

go to the course sorry go to the

resources and there is so many thing

right in the left hand side a project

netw workking property lock alert metrix

and all but here this uh project is uh

required okay now uh see guys what you

can do so first of all you can see this

particular icon launch AI uh launch AI

studio so uh once you will click on top

of this launch AI Studio you will be

able to launch this AI studio right so

let it launch and after this one uh see

guys here you can see all the options

similar to the Azure eii studio uh AZ

your open Studio but it is not this a

your openi studio it is a your eii

studio let me show you if you are

getting confused so this is what a your

Open studio just for the openi model and

all and this is a your EI studio for the

end to end thei application so what I'm

doing so first of all uh what I will

have to do over here I will have to

create a new project inside this one so

once you will scroll down you will be

getting a different different option

permission description project connected

sources and all everything so what you

have to do first guys click on this new

project and I'm going to be create my

own project let me write the name also

the name is going to be a trash course

okay same name I'm writing uh for

everything so that I won't be confused

and I can easily identify so this is

what is my project now project is

getting created guys it will take some

time again uh like uh one or two minute

so let it

create and after the project guys I'll

be showing you that from uh where

actually you can find out all the

resources and all so inside the project

all the resources will be there if it is

not there then simply we can connect it

also okay so guys here you can see my

project is done I created a project now

after creating the project you will find

out these many option left hand side

right so now uh just see uh let's uh

look into the options what all option is

there first uh let's look into this

component so you will find out the data

so whatever data basically you want to

keep you can keep the data similar to

the Azure uh openi Studio then you have

a indexes indexes with respect to the

vector database okay then here is a

deployment so whatever model right

whatever model basically you have

deployed you will be able to find out

each and every model over here now

content filtering so if you want to

filter any sort of a Content you can

create over here and you can filter that

right uh means uh you can connect it

with your model and application and you

will filtering that specific content now

here you can see the fine tuning yes

over here also you can do the fine

tuning and all now evaluation metrics

evaluation is also there you can perform

the evaluation you can create the

evaluation so ground Ruth relevance

coherence fluency everything basically

whatever metrix is required for

evaluating a model now tracing right so

here you can trace yourm application now

one more thing prom flow so prom flow

guys it is very much important and with

this also with this only we are going to

be create the Anto application now code

is there if you look into the code so

yes uh like you can create this code

okay you can select your CPU or GPU you

can select the virtual machine and over

there you can run your own code right so

these many functionality they are

providing to you now chat wise so chat

completion API completion API assistant

is also there image related like Delhi

and all everything is there and other

than this one model catalog model

Benchmark prompt catalog and all so this

thing is not required just for the

information and all you can check out so

first of all what we have to do see guys

you have to go inside the setting and

you have to connect with all the

services and all so guys once you will

go inside the setting here actually you

will be getting the option okay option

for the new connection so see these are

the services which is there okay

connected resources crash course model

this means my Azure open here is what

here is my artifact storage okay means

my blob storage and the other one like

the Vault and all uh and I will show you

one more a your AI search Once I will be

creating my rank with my custom data so

just click on this new connection guys

and here uh see there are like a

different different option you will find

out uh now you just need to click on

this aure openi service so here already

we have a service two Services first is

what crash course and this my audio

transcript so you are able to see the

service but it has not connected it okay

it has not connected so if it if if it

didn't connect it you can connect it

manually okay so after click on the

connect option you can

like connect it manually you can add the

connection now I want to add this

particular one so just click on this add

connection and after adding the

connection guys you will be able to find

out see it is connected now just close

it and go inside the deployment so once

you will go and check inside the

deployment so now you'll be able to find

out the same model which I'm having

inside where inside the a your open AI

okay inside this specific service so no

need to do it from scratch u means uh

all the model deployment and all

directly you can f the model over here

those particular model over here now one

more thing guys here see if you will go

and check with this create deployment so

here actually you will be able to find

out two option real time deployment and

pay as you go okay so you can select any

one from here so let's say if I'm going

to select this real time deployment now

here inside the real time deployment see

uh if I will scroll down so along with

this GPT And all I'll be getting the

other model as well like fee llama is

here okay

and apart from this one m is here and

this uh Nemo is there from the Nvidia

okay Desi is here and many different

different hugging face model and that is

what I was saying to you so inside this

azur studio it's not like that you are

just going to be use the opening model

no you can get the other model as well

and that's the beauty of the AZ AI

Studio I hope now you are getting my

point so let's do one thing guys let's

try to use this model so here I'm not

going to be uh like use any other model

other than this uh open a and all

because uh yes this open a model is a

sufficient for me as of now for creating

the application but if you want to use

uh you can use it I shown you the way

how to do it so uh let's do one thing

let's try to uh open this chat engine

okay this is my model and after opening

this chat engine what I can do so see

with respect to this one I'll be getting

my key and here is what here is my

target URL and all everything so just

click on this open playground I will be

open it I will be open I will be able to

open this particular model inside the

playground okay inside my chat

playground so let's wait uh yes you can

see the model over here now I can test

whether it is working or not so once you

will simply write here hi so if

everything is fine I'll be getting my

answer so yes uh this is working fine

now if I can uh ask some other question

so how are you so it is giving me answer

that yes I'm fine or whatever so okay

now let's try to ask something else I

hope it is visible to you let me keep it

over here and uh yeah great now let me

ask uh can you tell me the

detail uh can you tell me

about

the T okay which is capital of India

let's see whether this model will be

able to answer or not so here I can

see uh this model is able to give me

answer uh it's a GPD model so definitely

uh it can give me answer okay great now

uh I think it is perfect now one more

thing guys so once you will go inside

this deployment so here see already we

have this particular model now let's say

some if anyone model is not there so

what you can do you can just simply

click on this create uh deployment and

let's say this GPT is not there so just

click on the GPT GP 3.5 turbo and then

confirm it that's it okay you will be

able to get it right now let's say if

you are not getting this confirm option

so first connect with your a your openi

resources okay a your openi resources

and then you will be getting this

confirm option now I hope uh this is

perfect to all of you so let's do one

thing let's try to create our own custom

chatboard so what is the procedure of it

let me show you step by step once you

will go inside the chat guys here see so

uh just look over here that we are only

able to get so I think it has removed

okay fine now I'm going to be ask one

specific question hi can you give me a

price pricee of Nike Air Max shoes Okay

so this is my H question which I'm

asking so let's see what I'll be getting

over here so it is telling to me that as

a AI model I don't know about it okay I

don't having a specific information uh I

hope it is visible to you guys let me

hide to myself see so it is saying it is

not having a specific information with

respect to this particular question so I

want to create my own chatboard okay so

which can like answer for these type of

question so what I did here let me show

you I kept some data okay inside my

system and on top of that data basically

I'm going to be train what I'm going to

be train my model okay so uh just wait

let me open this so here is what guys

here is my data and I hope it is visible

to all of you see so this data actually

it is having an information related to

what Rel to the shoes so I just kept

only three uh like detail okay three

shoes detail because unnecessary it will

take a time if I'm going to be create a

rack system or if I'm going to be create

a like index and all so Nike ear Max

Plus Nike Dunk and Nike slide or sandal

so this is the information like style

code or Price Right date and here you

can see the manufacturing unit and all

location every sort of a detail you can

see over here with respect to this

document now what I'm doing I want to

create a custom chatboard which is uh

like which will be like giving me a

answer with respect to this true and all

so what I can do here so first of all I

have to add this particular data now for

adding the data guys here you can see

this option add your data now just click

over here on this add your data and

click on on top of this add a new data

sources okay now once you will click on

this add to the new data sources now

just select the data sources from here I

want to upload this file from my local

so here I selected this local now I I'm

going to be upload the single file so

here let me take this particular file so

the file name is what Sho so here I got

my file uh the file name is Sho now once

I will get this file I will click on

this next and here see it is asking me

about this a your AI search service so

let's try to see what is this a your AI

search service okay so here if you will

simply check with the Google let me uh

search over here as your AI

search search

okay now uh what is the Azure AI search

so just read about it Azure AI search

okay it is also called a your cognitive

search so guys just listen over here

whenever we are talking about this uh

aure cognitive search it's a very

important part of the rag okay because

it is uh this a your AI search or a your

cognitive search actually it is only

giving the uh permission right for the

similarity search and all okay so based

on the query whatever query will come it

is keeping inside the database and uh it

is keeping the data inside the database

now whatever query is coming it's going

to perform the similarity search keyword

search okay and the name is what so

before the name was the AER cognitive

service and now the name is what Z your

AI search provide secure information

retal at a scale over own contain

inational and generative AI Search

application so uh here in short you can

see it is nothing it's a information

retrieval Source okay it's a information

retrieval system if you want to read

more about it definitely you can check

over here so how it is going to work and

like the full flag uh uses and all okay

with respect to this uh a your AI search

right so what I have to do here I have

to configure my AIO eii search now

already I have so here what I can do I

can connect with that so already I had

created guys so this was the one now

this crash course now I'm just simply

click on clicking on this add connection

and and here I am getting it so if you

remember I've created it when I was

running the azeri studio when I was

keeping the data okay the custom data

and I created one chatbot before this

one as well so uh here my source name is

what crash course now index name I can

keep uh anything over here I can remove

this one so it's going to be my Vector

index my Vector

index now here you can select the

machine also so so let's say uh if you

want to select the machine for the

entire process so this is the like

options now yes you can go through with

this particular option and you can check

now I'm keeping it auto only now just s

on click or just select this Auto and

click on this next now here is what here

is your embedding model which is taking

from this crash course models itself

this is AI service AZ your openi service

now just click on this next and after

this one guys it is checking for the

model it is there or not yes it is there

then finally click on this create okay

so here actually you will be getting

this create see so this is what this is

my create button so I'm creating this

index and based on this particular index

I'm going to be perform the similarity

search over here so uh let's wait uh it

will take some time around one or 2

minute uh for creating this particular

index if your data is very very use in

that case it might take 10 to 15 minute

also so that's why I kept the small

amount of data but still it will take

some time so meanwhile what I can do I

can uh set up my environment and all

everything for creating my final

application now first of all guys here

I'll will be required some folder and

file so I'll will be required one file

that is what

app.py I will be required one more uh

file over here that is HTML which I'm

going to keep inside the templates okay

templates and that is going to my

chatbot UI so now here inside this uh

template I'm going to be create one file

so let me give it to you the code so

here my file name is going to be chatbot

HTML chatbot do HTML okay now uh here

inside this chatbot HTML I can keep the

code and this is but nothing this is my

HTML page okay so a very simple HTML

page I just created it for what for the

uh like for the queries and all it's not

a full flag chatbot and all means a full

flag chatboard page it's a simple uh

like UI okay with respect to this

chatboard and all I will showing you you

will get it now uh inside the app

actually I have to write a code with

respect to what flask and all because

here I'm going to be create my flask

application so uh let me give you that

code also or as I can write it down one

by one so the very first thing which is

required the flask only so simply I can

write the flask and guys here in this

particular uh environment flask is not

available so here I can simply say FL

sorry render uncore template so here is

what

template okay now what I will do so here

I'll be writing the further code so here

is what from flask request this is also

perfect now here uh I'm going to be take

this particular module as well so I have

this URL Li and this Json and this OS

okay so this particular module is

required now what I can do I can create

a my flas application so for that uh

actually I simply need to write Here app

is equal to flask so here flask and

inside the flask this name got it now

here I will be creating my URL so my URL

first URL is going to be uh app. route

and here I can simply write or okay I

can simply pass the SL which is

representing to the Home Route and then

I can pass the method so here is what

here is my method so method list so I

can get I can pass the get and uh post

method so first is post and the second

method which is going to be get only got

it guys I hope this is clear now coming

to the next part so uh what you can do

so here you can create the method which

is associated with this particular route

so here my method name is what

handore form so it is going to be handle

this particular form any anything you

can write any method name I just this

method name came in my mind I'm writing

it that's it so inside this particular

method you will be coding and or what

you will be doing you are going to be

return the particular template okay so

which template guys this chatbot do HTML

so simply you can write over here return

uh this uh return render template okay

render template and here you can mention

this

chatbot do HTML getting my point guyss

or no see I hope this is uh like fine to

all of you now guys what I can do I can

test my application okay so here you can

see it is uh still loading it is

creating the index okay let it complete

now now what I can do I can test it

whether it is working fine or not so uh

what I will do here so simply uh I'm

going to be write this uh python app.py

but before that I will have to install I

will have to install this flask okay

inside where inside this particular

environment so what is the command for

it f install plus simple now uh let me

install it and see it is installing

don't worry I will give you this each

and every command inside my GitHub I

will be keeping this entire code to my

GitHub and the link will be available

inside the descript deson guys so from

there itself you can download it so I

got my flask now what is the next thing

I can uh run here python

app.py so once I've learn it guys here

you can see everything is fine but there

is one thing which I need to add if name

is equal to main so here let me write

this name is equal to main okay so this

is perfect now simply I will write this

app. run and yes perfect so if I'm going

to be run it definitely I'll be able to

like get my URL okay and with that I can

access this sttm this chatbot page so uh

let me clear my screen CLS and I think

it is visible to all of you let me hide

to myself and here I'm going to be show

you this Comm python

app.py now see my application is running

now if I will open it so guys see this

is my chatbot page a very uh simple and

very easy uh very simple page over here

just to test the queries and all nothing

else so if you want to create any full

full flag chatbot and all full flag

chatbot page I can do that also but uh

later on I'll be showing you in my some

other video here just for the testing

around so guys uh let's do one thing

let's close it as of now and then uh

let's stop this particular process and

I'm going back to where I'm going back

to my Azo open AI now see here uh it is

showing to me that it has created okay

this index is created now where actually

sorry the chunking is done and here now

it is creating the index and all so the

first step is done chunking and the

Second Step what like it will be

creating the eming and all okay and then

on top of it like this entire thing

basically it's going to be keep inside

the index and then I can perform the

retrieval operation and all so uh I hope

uh this is done now if you want to check

how the process is going on so just do

one thing so just go inside this uh let

me show you where index is so once you

will click on this index just open this

particular index

okay now inside this index here is a one

option that option is called job detail

once you will click on this job detail

you will find out the entire detail of

this with respect to this particular job

so whatever job you have seen right you

will be finding out the detail step by

step detail with respect to that

particular job now here uh it is telling

to you my uh recent workspace my live

project just a second guys yeah this one

now just uh scroll down and see these

are the particular jobs guys inside this

Vector so what is my Vector name my

Vector index I think my name I written

in this way okay fine not an issue and

yes so this index is also completed and

now registering this particular index so

uh first of all let me uh like tell you

one thing let me talk about the rag

architecture until it is Crea I can give

you like little information related to

this rag architecture and all so in the

rag architecture what we do so let's say

we have a data now what I will do I will

be collecting this data and this

particular data I will be uh like

storing somewhere okay let's say this

data I kept inside the database then uh

from this particular database I'll will

be collecting this data again in the

form of chunks okay chunking I'll

perform the chunking because this data

might be very very huge so let's say

this is what this is my

chunks now with respect to this chunk

I'll be creating the embedding Okay so

so here I can write chunk this is also

my chunk here also my chunk okay now

I'll be creating the embedding so

embedding is nothing it's a numerical

representation of the data so here is

what here is my embeding this is also

repres to the representing same thing

and here also embedding now this

particular embedding guys whatever

embedding we have created I'll be

storing inside where inside the vector

database so here here is what here is my

Vector database or like this Vector

database or you can say Vector index

because this Vector database actually it

will provide you the vector index so the

same process is happening over there

itself so what they are doing you know

so whatever data I have provided the

shoe data they collected it means they

kept inside the database aure blob they

created a chunk from there okay if it is

required they will create otherwise no

because I kept every setting by default

so I'm assuming that they have created a

Chun because the process I can see over

there

then they have performed the iding with

respect to that the model right so

emding model which I loaded so by using

that particular model they have

performed the iding and then they stored

it right where inside the vector

database means by default they are using

the vector database or uh basically with

respect to that they are creating this

Vector index okay Vector database

actually it provide you the vector index

getting my point now what will happen

you know so whenever user is asking any

sort of a query so here let's say is my

query which is being asked by the user

so it will perform the similarity search

based on this particular query so let me

mention the similarity

search and here this uh context I will

be getting the context means I'll be

getting the detail this operation is

called retrieval operation and this a

particular context along with a prompt I

will be adding my prompt and this two

information I'll be passing to what I'll

be passing to my llm I think it is

visible now I'll be passing to my llm

now llm what it will do so it will read

this prom it will read this context and

finally it will be generated it will be

generating the answer with respect to

this particular query so this is the

whole sort of a process now uh just see

over here everything is done with

respect to my uh data now what I will do

if I'm going uh if I'm going now with a

CH chat so there I will be able to find

out my index okay somewhere uh it has uh

this particular index in some database I

don't know about it uh if I'm going to

check the detail definitely I'll be

getting but here you can think that it

has created the vector index now I can

uh select it okay so here is what here's

my Vector index which is already there

now I can select how it is going to be

find out the similar search so here I'm

going to be select both option one is

Vector and the second is what keyword

okay so hybrid option now uh let's say

uh uh let's ask the same question to my

chat bot over here to this uh okay so it

is tell me content cannot be empty

validation error message zero why it is

so guys I think I will have to select

the model so model is also there now let

me ask one more time just a

second okay great now I'm getting so

here uh what I can do I can ask what is

a price what is a price of nice sorry

Nike Air Max shoes

so previously actually it was not giving

me the answer but let's see whether it

is giving me answer or not so now here

the price of this Nike Air Max blush

true is what guys 150 USD if you will go

and check with the PDF you will be

finding out the same price okay now you

can ask any sort of a thing uh to your

uh model with respect to this data and

here see uh it is showing me the

reference also from where actually it is

taking a reference now I want to use

this rag system the rag this one retrial

argument generation in my own in my own

chatbot see here is what here is my

chatbot which I have created so let me

run it python app.py it is running on

top of this particular URL so see guys

here if I'm going to be run it so I will

be getting my chat board this one how I

can integrate this Rec system into this

chatboard now we'll see that particular

process so here guys if I want to do it

so uh I can do it right but how so this

prom flow is The Rescuer okay by using

this prom flow I can do it now uh let me

show you how it is possible so once you

will click on this prom flow uh this

prom flow basically what is the meaning

of the prom flow guys so by using this

prom flow you can schedule the end to

end pipeline okay end to end pipeline

from data injection to this uh like uh

retrieval and then this uh chatbot

generation and all means this data

generation and then deployment also so

what here basically what I did I have

created this pipeline now I'm going to

be deployed by using this prom flow so

I'm going to write my own name the name

is going to be crash course over here

now uh let me open it and here you can

see it will provide me the location as

well just simply click on this open and

see it is going to open this

particular

folder so just a second uh it will take

some time

so now see guys uh it has opened uh this

particular prom flow so uh inside this

prom flow see there are lots many option

okay so which option you need to select

so first of all see let me show you the

files and all so here uh you will be

able to get all the files because see at

the end this is nothing it's a code only

right so whatever I have I have done

over there uh the data uploaders that

data upload and all with respect to that

it has generated all the files and

folder see it is a search it is with

respect to the search this one see now

uh here you'll find out uh this one with

respect to the chunking and all see this

is the require. txt if you want to see

the content also uh you can like you

just need to double click on top of it

and here is what here is a content of

the file all it now what I'm doing see

uh for deploying this particular

application first of all you need to

select this drop down okay start comput

session and then just click on the first

option is start compute session now once

you will click over here guys so here

you will be able to find out it has

started the computation of this

particular session okay now once the

computation will be done I this chat

option will be eligible for me I can

chat to my model OKAY over here now

until what I can do I can give you the

complete walkth through of this prom

flow it is creating so uh see guys here

actually what this prom flow is doing it

is going to be create the entire flow so

from this llm so this is my llm name

okay now here is what here's the output

what output I will be getting okay from

my model then here you can see this is

the script and all the complete uh like

script it has created in a back end then

other than this one here you'll find out

the other thing like prompt and all how

it's going to Define The Prompt okay in

a back end for handling the for handling

each and everything now apart from this

one see extract search means like

keyword search and all whatever we are

going to be per form see with respect to

that there is a code so this each and

every code actually it took from where

tell me from my configuration so

whatever configuration I made over here

inside this chat I directly imported it

inside the prom flow and from there

actually it took this particular

configuration now let's say if we are

not doing like this if you want to

create our own custom flow okay so yes I

can do it once you will click over here

and once you will click the prom flow

and then you can fill the information

over here manually and according to that

it will be generating the

code that's it okay now see my

computation is done now I can chat with

my model okay so whatever model and

whatever data I have provided the rag

which I have created I can chat over

here so once I will click on this chat I

hope it is visible now let me keep to my

uh keep myself over here and see if I'm

going to ask any sort of a thing the

same thing to my chat about over here so

definitely I will be getting it so it is

running just a

second it takes some time if you are

running it first time definitely it will

be taking the time so simply click on

this uh this particular option or if you

will hit enter then also you will be

getting the

answer taking time guys taking time

yes running is still running and here

over the prom flow each and every

service will take some time if you want

to deploy the application it take around

10 to 15 minute okay

fine guys so here you can see we are

able to get an answer so here my answer

is hello how I can assist you now I can

ask something what is a price what is a

price of Nik here Max 2 let's see uh

I'll will be getting my answer on not so

it is taking some time over here guys

but don't worry uh once I will deploy

the endpoint URL it won't take this much

of time and we can configure this

latency on all everything I'll be

showing you how because at the end it

will give you the option to select the

instance

okay so let it are done

okay fine I'm getting my answer and the

price and all everything it is providing

to me so I hope guys uh you are able to

get that how to run this computer

session and how to test it now what is

the next thing I have to deploy I have

to public it okay I have to generate the

endpoint URL so that I can integrate in

my particular chat Bo so for that uh

here let me do one thing let me not this

one this one guys so what I can do guys

here I can click on this deploy okay so

let let me adjust to myself first of all

great uh fine now uh see just click on

this deploy here and after clicking on

this deploy it will ask you the uh like

some sort of a detail so first uh like

it is asking about the endpoint URL you

can uh keep you can write manually this

particular URL then deployment name you

can write the deployment name okay

manually but I'm keeping it I'm keeping

everything like by default only now here

is a virtual machine so 2 core 8 GB 16

uh 2 core 8 GB RAM and 16 GB is a dis

and here is the charges for the virtual

machine okay 0.1 per hour so I'm going

to be select this standard only but if

you want to select any custom one then

definitely you can select that also uh

let me show you where this one so once

you will click on this drop down you

will be getting all the option with

respect to the machine so that is what I

was telling to you if you want to make

your process faster you can like select

the instance according to your

requirement okay now what I'm doing so

here I'm keeping it this by default uh

this a particular machine only so what

is the which is the one so here is this

EXT standard one now after this one guys

the next thing is instance count so I

will be keeping three instance okay now

inferencing data collection okay so here

I'm keeping enable only all the

information by default now review and

create now uh see you can review all the

information one more time and finally

you can click on this create now see

here my application is going to be

deploy guys so it takes time it will

take some time now how you can check you

can check inside this notification so

this is a notification guys and my model

is getting deployed so once uh it will

be deployed you will get the

notification over here inside this

particular section so let it deploy

let's wait uh for some time until what I

can do I can write my code okay for the

further thing so uh here I was returning

this render template but uh I don't want

as of now this one I'm writing a full

flag code so first is what first uh is a

if else condition so here I'm going to

be write the condition my if condition

so inside this condition guys or I can

do one thing I can give you the entire

code and we can understand like a step

by step I think that would be great so

see this is my complete code guys it is

very simple very easy nothing is here

and uh easily you can understand this

particular code so inside this code see

what I have I have my if and else

condition so if request. method is post

in that case what I'm doing I'm getting

the user query okay from my user side

I'm converting uh this query in this

particular form okay this uh Json form

then here is a body okay means I'm going

to be dump it Json do dump data and then

I'm going to be encoded right so in this

particular format actually I want my

query this is a specific format which is

required okay to sending the query to my

end Point URL now here is my URL guys so

here actually I'll be keeping my URL

which I'm generating so let me remove

this one from here and let me keep my

URL I will be showing you how you will

be getting it now remove this API key

you can keep your API key I'll be

showing you how you will be getting it

then if not API key I can generate this

particular exception now this is my

header guys okay so in the header you

can see there is my uh like content this

is what application SL here is what here

is my API key and then this is my

application name okay the deployment

name now apart from this one see here

what I have I have my request so I'm

going to be request to this particular

end you endpoint URL here is my URL and

here I'm getting the response okay now

from this particular response I'm

collecting my text okay whatever uh

thing I required and then finally I'm

going to be return it to my HTML page

getting my point if it is going to

generate any sort of error in that case

there is my exception module now you

must be thinking from where I got this

particular code so guys I didn't get it

from my end I didn't write from my end I

got it from The Tell Me from where from

the uh like uh prom flow itself I'll be

showing you after deployment you will

get the entire template over there now

here uh in the else uh it's nothing so

yes if it is not a post request in that

case uh yes we are just showing this

particular template that's it now if you

will look into the HTML code now just go

and check with the HTML code so here uh

what I have so it is very simple code

now this is my header okay head and here

is my body in my body I have one div

this one right which is showing me a

reply this a particular div and this is

my form okay you can create form before

the DI this is also fine now here is my

form which is a like which is working on

this particular URL uh this slash only

and here I'm taking a user input okay

now after taking this user input what

I'm doing I'm uh like I'm click like we

are clicking on this submit and finally

uh I'll be getting my reply over here

based on the like query okay so this is

a simple HTML which uh I have written

for all of you and here is what here is

my app.py file now I have to keep this

two information over here so uh what I

can do I can check whether it is

deploying or not uh Let me refresh uh

this particular process and uh here I

think uh it is deploying so just a

second let me check guys whether it is

deploying or not

reloaded uh yeah see deployment is uh

yes yes yes it is deploying so just go

and check with the deployment detail you

will be getting each and everything over

here itself so detail is here guys this

one and uh here is what here is my URL

this one and this is my key okay right

hand side you can check and is still it

is creating see if you are not getting

the deployment and all inside the

notification you can simply refresh it

getting my point so uh here see it is

deploying and now this is my endpoint

URL which is required to me I'm just

going to be copy from here and simply

going to paste inside my code okay now

the next thing is what so here the next

thing is this uh API key so just copy

this API key from here and then keep it

inside your code okay so here I'm going

to be keep my API key now uh both thing

is done now what is required so here I

required my application name so I can

remove this my project this one and what

I can do I can keep my name so here is

my name guys crash course r y DD so this

is the name basically which was there

and if you remember then at the end

basically there was one so uh crashed

course r u y dd1 so this is the

particular uh requ request header and I

hope this is clear to all of you now

once it will be done guys I'll be making

the request to my endpoint URL it takes

some time so if you have initialized uh

maybe uh at 150 and it will be done

within like 10 to 15 minute this is a

very minimum time for it it might take

more than that uh as well so if you want

to increase the time in that case you

will have to play with the instance

configuration and all everything so let

it complete and then uh we'll hit the

URL guys

so here guys you can see my deployment

is done so uh uh guys uh whatever name

uh basically I given to the deployment

it was giving me the issue uh I just I

check with the log and all because uh

previously during my practice I already

created with the same name so what I did

I uh changed my name over here rest of

the process will be same nothing uh will

be there so uh you can check out uh
